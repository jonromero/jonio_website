I'm your competition &amp;amp; whether you like it or not, you're being compared to me and guys like me. I don't have noticeable flaws, emotional hangups, or needy tendencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you are playing video games, I am out running and doing sports. While you're picking out your outfit, I'm doing crunches so I can take my clothes off. While you're at your job, I'm at my career. While you're hanging in your parents basement, I'm traveling around the world. While you're questioning whether or not she likes you, I've already found out. When you're pining over the one that got away, I'm making her laugh but walking away because she's not that interesting. And the worst part is, you probably hold women in higher regard than I do, and treat them with more respect, care, and kindness than I ever have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you hate me? &lt;strong&gt;You should&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I'm the guy she wishes your text was from. I'm the guy that makes you feel 2 inches tall. I'm the reason that women have their emotions guarded and I'm the guy you'd punch out if you weren't such a little bitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can't find enough motivation to change your life just by thinking about all the beautiful ladies you don't know yet, you can find that motivation by thinking about me, messing around with the feelings of the love of your life and then not calling her. You've got to be better, work harder, and do more to be her hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can just skip your workout today, stay home tonight &amp;amp; jerk off. Please do, because that makes it so much easier for me and all the other assholes like me.&lt;/p&gt;

This place is brand new (and white!) and it is going to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know what will happen with my previous domain (&lt;a href="http://jon.is.emotionull.com"&gt;emotionull&lt;/a&gt;) but I think it might be the new home for a new (underground) social network for traders. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hobby project right now, is a new opensource trading platform (for the first time not focused on HFT) and some experiments around a super fast, vertical scaling, full adhoc queries database (exactly the opposite of &lt;a href="http://www.bugsense.com/about/bigdata"&gt;LDB&lt;/a&gt; I've built at &lt;a href="http://www.bugsense.com"&gt;BugSense&lt;/a&gt;). I'll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good times!&lt;/p&gt;
