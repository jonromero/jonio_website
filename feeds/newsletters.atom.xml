&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Most &lt;strong&gt;Entrepreneurs try to "become rich"&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 just from their work: their Startup, their business, their "job". But I can tell you that from my vast experience, most Entrepreneurs (me included) made a considerable amount of life-changing money from their companies but 🔟 times more through "other paths".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like my friend Michael (we never met, but I consider him a friend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/n67UZO6OjveCgo5XWL0U2EgP2PYYGmmvPSqg6QAD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He made tons of money by dunking on people's faces, but he made &lt;strong&gt;10x&lt;/strong&gt; while chilling at his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Like with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nike&lt;/strong&gt;_and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Jordan's&lt;/strong&gt;_. Air Jordan's are a separate brand, and Michael makes 10% just because he is Michael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Also, Michael is an investor in Epic Games (the creator of Fortnite - a game that made $5 Billion a couple of years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Then he bought an NBA Team for $300M. That team (Charlotte Hornets) is worth around $2 Billion right now. He made more money with this than when he was an active basketball player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 There are tons of other stories (like investing in a big NFT company, creating a NASCAR team, and tons more) that you can read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1495764635085156355?t=xm6H7C3ZTiM20HMNkza5Qw&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;in this excellent Twitter thread.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is there are many ways to skin a cat. But you have to be a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ As you may know, &lt;strong&gt;I am obsessed with storytelling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story telling + Commitment + Financial knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; are the only skills needed to create anything you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that one of my favorite Film Makers / Storytellers (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Caseyneistatofficial"&gt;CaseyNeistat&lt;/a&gt;) - Casey - has a course, I knew I had to take it. I was concerned about the time commitment as the course goes non-stop for a whole month and is pretty brutal. Thankfully my wife Katya got it to me as a gift 🎁 so that I wouldn't make any excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is that you'll learn how to improve your storytelling skills, and you'll create two short videos in 30 days. Long story short, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/u3VJo9evfVg"&gt;my first short video is here&lt;/a&gt;, and it is about &lt;strong&gt;garbage bins&lt;/strong&gt;🚮.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose a topic that is pretty boring to work on how I can make things interesting. Anyone can make a video about something exciting, but what about something that is painfully boring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that all my other videos will also improve. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Let's talk about secret identities and Alter Egos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/RvZ4lVctbYDGsOD8KbCSOfKDQv91HMiuGzPPqNXx16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alter-Ego-Effect-Identities-Transform/dp/0062838636/"&gt;The Alter Ego Effect&lt;/a&gt;, Todd Herman talks about how we can fabricate an alternative persona that is "better at the things we are not". You might know this as "fake it until you make it". Why do we want to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we end up becoming what we think we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down&lt;/strong&gt; what part you want to improve/change and &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want to be more confident to be more social? Write this down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;crazy detailed image&lt;/strong&gt; of your Alter Ego. What "you" wear, drink, eat, watch TV, the music you hear, things you like, things you hate, places you want to go on vacations - the more detailed, the better. Let your imagination create a persona that would thrive in an environment where you have your challenges. Write this down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give your Alter Ego their &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-psychology-behind-superhero-origin-stories-4015776/"&gt;Heroic Origin Story&lt;/a&gt;. You need to have a glorious part. A past of successes and kicking ass. Create that past. Write it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it has to be different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your &lt;strong&gt;cape&lt;/strong&gt;. Clark Kent (Superman) had glasses. You need to have an item that "activates" your persona. It is your costume. Some ideas are wearing a bracelet or a ring. When you wear the item, the Alter Ego is on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have everything visualize it. Read your notes every day and visualize that persona. It works spectacularly well in new places when people don't know you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea is that you harvest the "feelings" of that persona and not necessarily change your whole appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you are on vacation, let your Alter Ego take control. Just don't try to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;New York has its first "NFT ATM" 🏧, and it's really weird as its sounds!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neonapp.com/"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; is an NFT marketplace aiming to make buying an NFT "as simple as buying a toothbrush" – which means using an old-fashioned credit card and a literal, physical vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 So, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/28/nft-vending-machine-new-york-blockchain"&gt;what is it like to use a Vending Machine to buy NFTs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it is fairly simple. You walk into an NFT ATM and buy one using your credit card. Currently, you can buy two different NFTs; "color" for $5.99 and a "party pigeon" for $420.69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 But, what do I buy actually, and what can I do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's impossible to own a color. What you own is a "proof of ownership" on the Solana blockchain that represents that particular color. 
People collect NFTs to trade them and sell them. Mostly, you are buying it to show it off, and there is no promise of future value. No one can ever sell you an NFT as a great investment. That's bulls**t. You should buy the art if you like it and connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Guess who is trying to copy my &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHOP. 🥞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my European friends, IHOP is a huge restaurant that specializes in pancakes. IHOP decided to start &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2022/03/09/ihop-launches-a-new-digitally-enabled-loyalty-program/?sh=2f3d0b712acc"&gt;giving away PanCoins&lt;/a&gt; that you can redeem as coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, they don't have a fancy app as I do, but I am definitely going to add functionality to convert your $Victory to $PanCoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, here is &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/clarkkent"&gt;a link for 10 $Victory coins&lt;/a&gt; for the first ten of you that is fast enough to claim them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, you should be able to redeem 🎫 them for cool stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week, my friend Kyriakos suggested playing a video game called &lt;strong&gt;"Vampire Survivors"&lt;/strong&gt;. I think games are interactive movies, and creating an addictive and interesting game requires a lot of skills. Most of these skills apply to Startups, businesses even life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/DQX2psC1A2Z9sfJOinyKsiqtzGkwkn2ENCLhs4kK16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vampire Survivors is a very simple game. Very simple graphics. Very simple story. Trivial to learn and play. The game is still in "alpha version" meaning that it hasn't been released fully yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it is already insanely successful with more than 77k players per day!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante"&gt;Slaying monsters in Vampire Survivors is like walking through a casino&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/vampire-survivors-indie-game/"&gt;It is a dopamine hit&lt;/a&gt;. The game costs $3 and has generated at this moment millions in revenue without being out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch the game on YouTube (don't download it, you'll lose your sleep), you'll see simple mechanics and low-quality graphics. What is remarkable is that this little $3 game is more engaging than other games that had a $100M budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎯 My point? Focus on providing value. Money doesn't buy value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In this week's video, I talk about the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knfsx0KisV4"&gt;three things I learnt from pitching to tons of Silicon Valley VCs.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ There are not the usual stuff you read on blog posts. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/Y4FuHl90Tt6lBTyRrk1y4MqFftcwZ3SQn7BNLViu16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knfsx0KisV4"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;This email has generated $4B revenue.&lt;/strong&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Amazon's email about the price increase of Amazon Prime. Just like that. One email and tons of money hitting the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/eUYJW8vjxIdaF6FMEhNx3Mwfwn3XVXARXJU6t7ny16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love subscription products!&lt;/strong&gt; But not all companies can pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen tons of companies trying to increase prices, and most of them are welcomed by backlash and lowered sales. How is Amazon doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon tries to integrate its services as close as possible into our everyday life. They try to become essential. The moment it is more painful waiting 5 days for your delivery than paying a few dollars per year, Amazon turns into a painkiller than a vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe vitamins are good for you, but when you have a headache, you'll give anything to make it stop. These are the best products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See originally on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/c_gro/status/1494804477857067010?s=20&amp;amp;t=4c1gVrEMpgOU0BukASBSvg"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;My Social token $Victory ($✌️) went live this week!&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and starting next week; I'll start posting videos and YouTube Live describing how I made,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the web3 app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the smart contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the marketing and design behind it
and tons more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🛒I hope I'll start adding things that you can &lt;strong&gt;"buy"&lt;/strong&gt; with your $Victory in the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can &lt;strong&gt;claim for free 99 $Victory by following &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/firstdrop"&gt;this link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 🔗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡I would love to hear your feedback and ideas on how this currency can be used (trust me, I have 1000 ideas)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Building prototypes is my favorite thing.&lt;/strong&gt; ⚒️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; exploring customer dynamics and behaviors, and I launch hundreds of tiny prototypes every year to verify my assumptions (I learnt that the hard way after spending tons of time building products that no one wanted)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://paulshustak.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-and-testing-mvps-88cc12118a16"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; is from my friend Paul, a kickass Product Manager, about building MVPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is the "Piecemeal MVP". Which one is your favorite❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This is how Coinbase made (probably) a 20x return from their ad in &lt;strong&gt;Super Bowl.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you spend $6M for a 30-second ad? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it might sound stupid, but these are the prices you pay to advertise during the biggest athletic event in the U.S. - the Super Bowl. This year, most ads were about electric vehicles and (of course) crypto, with Coinbase stealing the show. If you haven't watched Coinbase's ad, you can see it below (yes, that is the ad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/eZLG9iVwUcCQ9v8RsjEaoJVD4V9oPv2a61QNsg8D16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But did Coinbase ad make any money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lifetime Value of a customer for Coinbase is &lt;strong&gt;$250 (on average)&lt;/strong&gt;. To break even, Coinbase will need &lt;strong&gt;24k new users.&lt;/strong&gt; But they also gave away &lt;strong&gt;$15&lt;/strong&gt; to each user so let's say &lt;strong&gt;26k new users&lt;/strong&gt; to break even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, an ad has a 1% to 3% conversion rate (and usually ads, where you give away money, have a higher conversion rate). Let's go with a 0.5% conversation rate to be very conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total eyeballs that watched Super Ball were 117M. That means 117M * 0.5% = &lt;strong&gt;585k new converted users&lt;/strong&gt; which translates a &lt;strong&gt;~20x return of investment (ROI)&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, 20x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinbase spent $6M and probably "made" ~ $120M&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound stupid, right? 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The calculations are ballpark (Super Bowl park!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ During my last couple of emails, I told you about &lt;strong&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/strong&gt; - my social currency - and I've promised you to send you some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, I have news! This week I'll post on my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; the official link that you can go and &lt;strong&gt;claim your free $Victory coins plus places you can spend them!&lt;/strong&gt; And if you've sent me an email in the past to claim your $Victory, you'll get another link too! And there is more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have documented the whole process in a mini-YouTube series where I go over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to create your own currency,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to create your own web3 app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to design it and market it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All. Of. It. Just &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;subscribe on my channel&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't miss this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://github.com/jonromero/jonio_website/blob/master/content/images/youtube/youtube_cover_image.png?raw=true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Most of you are sending me emails about exciting things you found. And I want to include you in the process (and give you some sweet $Victory!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a small paragraph about something that you found interesting in Startups, Products, web3, or Crypto and &lt;strong&gt;get 10 $Victory&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/oNmbWDjPeu5TjezY8"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; and submit a story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I choose to include your paragraph in the newsletter, I'll send you 10 $Victory, mention you on my newsletter, Linkedin (and sometimes Twitter and Instagram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how that goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Let me introduce you to your new obsession: the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Internet Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory (or should I say conspiracy theory?) talks about how the internet is fake, and most interactions come from an A.I. that has been taken over. Follow up the rabbit hole; it is quite interesting - unless you don't really exist, and I am posting just for the amusement of bots (unless I am also a bot 🤖!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ If you've never been to Disneyland, I can assure you it is a pretty fun place (I prefer the one in France btw). But some people really really really want their everyday Disney dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why Disney decided to create a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937210/disney-residential-communities-storyliving-cotino-planned-town"&gt;Storyline community&lt;/a&gt; where you can buy (or rent) a house and live next to Goofy, Micky, and Mini!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's your move Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ There is &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; better than starting your day with a hilarious conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the story of how two hackers stole &lt;strong&gt;4 Billion in Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 and got arrested by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/QVS9Bn3ZMRjQL459GGU63u7H0tx07Q7cGkQ2j0un16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a cryptocurrency exchange was hacked and 4.5 Billion dollars (in Bitcoin) went poof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities were watching in awe the masterminds that hacked the exchange and were using algorithmic trading programs, dark pools, chain hopping and all these extremely sophisticated technics in order to elude the tight grasp of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of a sudden, these hackers started buying NFTs, $500 Wallmart cards and posting on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liz_franczak/status/1491109758035968000?s=20&amp;amp;t=2eGgDswEDuQX0fOSqspLSQ"&gt;Tik Tok hilarious videos&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbc4eaNevjU"&gt;most epic video you can imagine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us recap: a super highly technological group of hackers, posts cringe-worthy videos, goes to &lt;strong&gt;hide in New York&lt;/strong&gt;, knows from November that are under investigation (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ckreimendahl/status/1491252846624665600?s=20&amp;amp;t=2eGgDswEDuQX0fOSqspLSQ"&gt;but doesn't seem to care&lt;/a&gt;) and they get hacked by the FBI because they kept the keys to their 4 Billion dollars &lt;strong&gt;IN DROPBOX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have watched the links above, you can see there is no chance that these people are even capable of using a pen so hacking crypto-exchanges and taunting FBI is out of their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being wealthy and unknown is better than rich and famous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Switching gears! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPk6xsXwtz8"&gt;In this week's video&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about five mistakes that every Entrepreneur does - and obviously I have done in the past. &lt;strong&gt;But that's how you learn!&lt;/strong&gt;
I am going to do a series with all the things I've learnt (talking to Silicon Valley VC, raising money, losing money etc) so make sure you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;subscribe to the channel&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the video. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/4qycswX7Wbh3wewKqQ4Uo8j5U2plKiHvf3ZxbWs016325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A lot of people tell me that they are not cut for Entrepreneurship. They want the financial security a company can provide.
I can tell you that if I managed to build and run companies then anyone can do it. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial security is a myth. &lt;strong&gt;You and only you&lt;/strong&gt; can control your financial well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926095/peloton-ceo-all-hands-fired-employees"&gt;Peloton decided to fire 2800 people in one go&lt;/a&gt;. But at least everyone got a free membership. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60059259"&gt;Zoom fired 900 people over a ... Zoom call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a company is trading your time for a 10% of your value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Guess who is going into the Metaverse? &lt;strong&gt;Apple!&lt;/strong&gt; It seems a new VR headset will be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/09/apple-realityos-ar-vr-headset-reference/"&gt;released this or next year&lt;/a&gt;. Why you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook knows that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/meta-may-pull-facebook-instagram-from-europe-over-data-rules"&gt;the days of web2 are numbered&lt;/a&gt;. People want more immersion, more connectivity. And 1 billion in revenue kind of proves that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/92566/gucci-buys-land-ethereum-the-sandbox-metaverse-experiences"&gt;And Gucci just bought some land in the Metaverse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things seem silly until we fully understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ On the other hand, it is always good to be aware that "what goes up, goes down". Tim O'Reilly who coined the term &lt;strong&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/strong&gt; talks about the crash that is going to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cryptocurrency-nft-blockchain-web3-tim-oreilly/"&gt;inevitably come to the crypto space.&lt;/a&gt;
Or he is just angry that we moved to web3 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about being right but being right at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Let's talk about expensive bags and their "underground story".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a brand that sells bags for $13k to $2M. Yes, I know. Who wants an expensive bag when you can buy &lt;a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-sold-for-2-85-million-in-eth/"&gt;an NFT with that kind of money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the interesting part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot just "walk" into a shop and buy this bag. There is a waiting list, and usually, it is 5 years (or way more). I am talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/story/106191-birkin/"&gt;Birkin bags&lt;/a&gt;.
There are a couple of tricks to get higher on the list and sometimes get one on the spot. The easiest way is to be a man.
Based on some super underground info (Reddit), a man that buys a Birkin bag as a gift won't overthink it and won't have any special requirements (color, fabric, etc.). It is a much easier and faster sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In the latest video, I review the pitch deck of a Startup that almost every engineer I know wanted to build something similar; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51AIADVpv4"&gt;A one-page website generator&lt;/a&gt;
And this company nails it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the video. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/npoNFQV2Fii9Lla8iBgM9hucWqcSJ0I0og5K2O9x16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51AIADVpv4"&gt;Click to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I have played Wordle once. If you don't know what Wordle is, welcome back from the cave you've been in the last couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer built a super simple game for his partner during the pandemic in order to kill time. The game is extremely addictive, and for this reason, he decided that you can play only once per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition"&gt;New York Times just acquired the game.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordle is the definition of KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. If something has value for people, you don't need fancy websites, marketing, or crazy funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ It was 2013, and I was in San Francisco reading the news about a European program that was going to "fund" new VCs. This would have been the beginning of the Startup community in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that most of these "VCs", were cookie-cutters: no Entrepreneurial background, no investing background. To kickstart a revolution, a radical change, you need people that take insane risks and act before anyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need leaders, not followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to start my own "fund" with zero money. I called it &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/zerofund"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The ZeroFund"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I was giving zero money for zero equity. Yes, zero for zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was giving something more important than anyone else. Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; to be part of ZeroFund was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to register your company (for free) on the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were sent a website template (one-pager), and you had to fill it up with images/videos/photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to "rally" to bring visitors to your website, and they could pledge "virtual money". If you managed to raise more than the threshold, you were going to the Stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stage was a live event, where you had to present your company live to all your supporters. Then you had to raise $700 from them, something that would give you access to a co-working space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This superfast process forced you to &lt;strong&gt;launch&lt;/strong&gt;, look for &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt; and get your first "paying" &lt;strong&gt;customers&lt;/strong&gt;, all while supporting co-working spaces and making your product known. What else do you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroFund went viral.&lt;/strong&gt; Google and Microsoft donated servers. Hundreds of people started following the companies. A-List mentors joined to help the Startups (CTO of AOL, right-hand man of Bill Gates, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.). An accelerator in Silicon Valley flew the companies to a pitch-deck retreat in Italy. And one Startup got funding - and they made it to Series B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund was all about zero sum: We all win when we all win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never gave money, but we provided access to a huge network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never took a percentage, but we got to meet some epic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I remember this after 9 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these companies &lt;a href="https://www-benzinga-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25331804"&gt;got acquired for $75M yesterday.&lt;/a&gt; Insane. 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund during the years took different forms, and occasionally I get an email about restarting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 Maybe now with crypto, it could be even easier. Or maybe there is no need because there are so many VCs out there. Or perhaps now it is a bigger need than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FsOu7aO1A"&gt;This is a video (in Greek) that covers ZeroFund on the Stage day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Meet  &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela"&gt;Miquela&lt;/a&gt;. Miquela is a &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Influencer&lt;/strong&gt;. That means that she is not real. Actually, the girl behind her is also not real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/15DuXsCKCePaJMiIpvU4Jqm9Q894kwgJotplWO9E16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miquela has a YouTube channel, video clips, a hit on Spotify, and in 2020, she made $11M. And she is not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Influencers are becoming more common, and people are obsessing over them. Even &lt;a href="https://www.virtualhumans.org/article/jennifer-aniston-launches-virtual-pet-clydeo"&gt;Jennifer Aniston&lt;/a&gt; launched a Virtual Influencer (hint: it is a dog 🐶).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do people really care about something that is not real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the story telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love stories. It puts our brain into a different mode. And this is what I've been saying to all Entrepreneurs: "Sell the story then build the product."
Even if you have no interest in influencers, it is a masterclass in building a brand, storytelling, and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really live in exciting times 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This is the story, how a DAO bought the wrong item, at the wrong price, for the wrong reasons and lost $3M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple newsletters ago, I talked about how a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/can-academics-build-products"&gt;DAO bought the unreleased album of Wu-Tang from FBI for $4M&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, a lot of stuff were bought from DAOs but one of them was &lt;strong&gt;remarkably stupid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for whatever reason you don't know what a DAO is, check &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;this video I made for you&lt;/a&gt;. Back to our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpiceDAO is a DAO with the simple mission to buy the book of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)"&gt;"Dune"&lt;/a&gt;. Money were raised, high fives were given but something went wrong. Very wrong.
First, the bought the wrong book. Instead of buying the &lt;strong&gt;Frank Herbert’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, they bought the hilarious film adaptation of  &lt;strong&gt;Jodorowsky’s&lt;/strong&gt; Dune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know about Jodorowsky's adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cJNR8HEw0"&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;. Personally I believe it is a (hilarious) masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more. Oh, there is more.
The idea was that, after the acquisition of the book, they can create NFTs based on it's chapters and then burn the book! Then it only exists in the &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;. 
The issue of course is that when you buy something, &lt;strong&gt;you don't own the IP&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, if I buy a BMW I cannot start selling t-shirts with BMW's logo! 
Sadly, the DAO learnt about this after acquiring the book for $3M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know what you are thinking right now. They can still sell the book back right? 
&lt;strong&gt;Nope&lt;/strong&gt;. The actual book costs $30k. Yes, &lt;strong&gt;$30k&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's ok, &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a38815538/dune-crypto-nft-sale-mistake-explained/"&gt;we all do mistakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ This week, we broke the 300 subscribers on my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. I am loving it! If you haven't subscribed, consider doing it - it is awesome stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest video, I review the pitch deck of a Startup that kept me excited during the whole time. Very nice pacing and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mM_MGWt8DrE"&gt;on the video&lt;/a&gt;, I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/itPjpQ8TMSXxH7Rv0LLrMYCbpzL6d7524T0oZBLW16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mM_MGWt8DrE"&gt;Click to see this epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ If I read back to you the following sentence a couple years ago, you would be looking at me like I am a crazy person.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Meta (Facebook) has created a &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-parent-meta-creates-powerful-ai-supercomputer-to-support-metaverse-01643061310"&gt;supercomputer A.I to support the Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through this again.
Facebook, oh sorry I meant Meta, has created the fastest supercomputer with A.I (whatever that means) to support the metaverse - whatever the metaverse might be. 
If they have added "&lt;strong&gt;web3&lt;/strong&gt;" and "&lt;strong&gt;DAO&lt;/strong&gt;" they would have ticked all the boxes 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ It seems that DAOs are making VCs even more irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you shouldn't need to raise outside money because you can raise faster from your community. And now, you can start your own "VC" with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://syndicate.io/"&gt;SyndicateDAO&lt;/a&gt; - (disclosure: I am somewhat affiliated with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/zdQrIEqc40Ij0bzhaU7N1f55ZYZ6xRSq9zQskWB816325"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO"&gt;SyndicateDAO&lt;/a&gt; you can create an investment DAO and invite friends to invest with you. And no, this is not a paid advertisement as there are still tons of issues (see: regulations).
You can picture it as &lt;a href="https://angel.co/"&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt; but faster, cheaper and more transparent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we do a Syndicate for the companies that I review on my YouTube channel - and make sense to invest in? What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ To make it big in life, you need to take risks. Build your own company, invest aggressively, shoot for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk took "the shoot for the moon" part, a bit literally as one of the SpaceX's rockets will &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60148543"&gt;crash into the moon and explode&lt;/a&gt;. 
Well at least it won't come &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3wZRdg-Tmo"&gt;crashing down back to Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Do you want to make $1M 💰 while sitting in front of your computer? Take a selfie! 🤳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Indonesian college student decided to take one selfie every day for three years (or 993 days to be exact). Then, because he wanted to learn about NFTS, he decided to release them as an NFT collection. That collection just broke &lt;strong&gt;$1M in sales&lt;/strong&gt;. Crazy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are wondering how he did that, he shared exactly his process on how to make $1M with NFTs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there were more than 230+ sold, and I still don't understand why you want to buy NFT photos of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ This week review the pitch deck of a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1vS17uiDw"&gt;Startup that has a great idea but the pitch deck is ... very weak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's ok! That's why I am doing these videos and I am sure that with a little bit of love (and hype!), they can make an excellent pitch deck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion, so please leave a comment on the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/EuxZl71RpSYveMKJTXH05pF6TfiOqV4NfYzaAPUg16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1vS17uiDw"&gt;See this epic video here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;DO IT NOW.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Have you ever watched Shark Tank, the show where Startups pitch their ideas and four investors decided whether to put money or not? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/413391"&gt;GoingPublic&lt;/a&gt;, a show where the &lt;strong&gt;viewer&lt;/strong&gt; can also invest from their couch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is thanks to a new regulation in the US, where anyone can invest without being a "professional investor" or any specific (high) income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you ever invest in any companies from "Shark Tank"? Why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ World of Women is an NFT collection that has taken over the Internet ($21M in sales). 
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ReeseW"&gt;Reese Witherspoon&lt;/a&gt; is a big promoter along with tons of other Celebrities and as it was expected we are going to have the first NFTs &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90379/world-of-women-ethereum-nfts-surge-bored-apes-hollywood?amp=1"&gt;making it into Hollywood movies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and yes, we checked that this project is actually made "by women" as in the past &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/78329/ethereum-nft-fraud-fame-lady-squad"&gt;another project&lt;/a&gt; claimed it was by women (it was not) and after they got exposed they handed over the project to a women's group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/xkbqXNdGKlEFAQEMseSFyo2PpE9VO9tZZqxYdr4716325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Instagrammers. Cloning. Dead Pets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much crazier this 2022 could get? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pet-cloning-becomes-more-popular-instagrammers-begin-replicating-deceased-pets-1670491"&gt;cloning pets&lt;/a&gt; has become pretty popular. And it is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; expensive. 
A cloning company says that the prices are around $50k for a dog, $35k for a cat and $45k for a horse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story in the article above, talks about a cat that had around 45k followers and sadly died. The owner decided to clone the dead cat which now shares an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/adogandacat/"&gt;account with a dog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This week I review the pitch deck of a Startup that wants to make it easier for you to buy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ"&gt;Real Estate ... in the Metaverse!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea but there is an issue that I haven't talked about in any other video and it has to do with Startups that have only &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion, so please leave a comment on the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Mud9dYrfZCNyBu_E4b8MVyIAZ1qNy7aW__CyR3l6ieAH_iNv3VotVbSoDF0f2u_29MAxual5JyDJBHHGF1tpdRN__3MJU0BCgDZzhzbLQVJQDVcptUQLMp95P5gBI-Bvse_0ZQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/JEmgROsGWr8jN0Y3Hz2eytcgJWN7IEoAL1K2zYK316325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/wlyq86"&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Ready to have your mind blown into pieces? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3162257/chinese-scientists-build-factory-robot-can-read-minds-assembly"&gt;China has built a factory robot that reads minds&lt;/a&gt;.
Why? So it can predict their needs you silly! And here is the scenario.
You want a wrench? Why lose those precious 3 seconds to think and act when &lt;strong&gt;a machine can sense your needs and grab it for you&lt;/strong&gt;? Isn't all about optimization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion about this - let me know what you think at 📥 me@jon.io&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ What is Wrong with Being Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people never work as hard as they do when they are trying to prove themselves right. &lt;strong&gt;But not you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you will catch yourself caring more about being right than to get the best possible outcome, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;STOP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I want to be right? Or do I care more about creating the best possible work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be unbeatable, you have to give up on always trying to "be right" and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOCUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on what truly matters. Don't get trapped on the &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/"&gt;Wrong Side of Right!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Whoa! Today we made it to number (4) without talking about NFTs! Let's change that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea how big was the creators' economy using Ethereum in 2021? Take a guess, I'll wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1479478884072505346?t=KfQ9krEz3uTOgdUMzP9yig&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;3.5 Billion&lt;/a&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSANE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets me very sad when I see people missing out on this great wealth shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Oh who knew! &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-floyd-mayweather-jr-sued-for-allegedly-making-false-statements-about-the-crypto-ethereummax-11641918153"&gt;Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather Jr. sued for involvement in alleged crypto scam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CityDAO/status/1480421505385197575?s=20"&gt;Tons of hacks&lt;/a&gt; in the crypto space and a lot of scams going around so be EXTREMELY careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that matters in the end is community and adoption. Anything else is just hype and sophisticated scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ There is a famous A.I paradigm called "This X doesn't exist". For example if you go to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/74o2or"&gt;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&lt;/a&gt;, you will see a new face generated using A.I every time. You can do the same for &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/ynolod"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/rvnonz"&gt;Startups&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/op0609"&gt;resumes&lt;/a&gt; and I even had my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/qwzn6g"&gt;own for products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of them is terrifying. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gxd2"&gt;This climate does not exist&lt;/a&gt;. It is using A.I to show you how YOUR home (or any address or monument you like) is when climate conditions go astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/2yj207"&gt;Monastiraki in Athens/Greece&lt;/a&gt;, a very popular place near Acropolis - almost underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/S3nt-znUg7BCAPuZU0iy0Z7HQ4db7255bQTN3AJD9jtT6fxQMcnWDvQf7WprCW3W7TttQh46K_GtgMIdVGAccjuHcGHYPAft5sVSsWYD5Ifxl9szRXTAfKoMa9zMT-4Y7Y9wTQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/F8xmYNiBdy80TceBrrSebwST8wMAG2yGsdeEZf5I16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Ozzy Osborne launched an NFT project and &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gex8"&gt;the video is hilarious&lt;/a&gt;. More than 70k have joined the Discord in one day, waiting to buy CryptoBatz (yes, blood thirsty pixelated bats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least is WAY better than &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/nne26v"&gt;Matt Damon's embarrassing ad for Crypto.com&lt;/a&gt; which personally I liked but but &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/llx6y0"&gt;most of the Internet has gone ballistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Remember when &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/rvnyo9"&gt;I joined a DAO that raised ~$10M and bought some real estate in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; to build a Metacity? Well, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/op055o"&gt;another DAO is buying golf courses&lt;/a&gt; and they just raised $10M in 48 hours by selling NFTs. And another wants to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/zpg22w"&gt;purchase a dead brand and relaunch it as a streaming service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this space absolutely crazy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ But what is more interesting is a story from my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/qwzggv"&gt;NFT platform&lt;/a&gt; (I need to write a whole book about these stories):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was summer of 2021 and we were selling exclusively Celebrity NFTs. That meant talking and meeting celebrities, their manager and with their agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, after we decided to drop all custom projects and just provide services for creators and APIs for platforms, we started printing money (ether). Back to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the top five agencies in LA (and dare to say in the world?) approached us for another project. And based on our past experiences, agencies (and specifically Celebrities) don't know how to sale NFTs or interact with their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were approached to assist with the drop of photos taken by a photographer of a dead Celebrity. Of course there was no community behind this (&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gee8"&gt;it is one of the five deadly sins of selling NFTs&lt;/a&gt;). And of course they wanted to sale at a crazy price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that we were not a good fit and told them as a friendly advice not to use OpenSea but another platform (again, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gee8"&gt;using OpenSea is another deadly sin&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short and $1M spent in marketing after using OpenSea, they sold &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny story is that this happened three times. Three. Freaking. Times. Millions of dollars spent and zero sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. You pay and you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ This week I review the pitch deck of a 100% &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/9r5k7y"&gt;Bamboo Toilet Paper company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, the deck had some issues the first five slides but then OMG it turned around! One slide made the whole difference and someone from my team will reach out to learn more information. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/9r5k7y"&gt;Check the video here&lt;/a&gt; and there is surprise as always ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/exWJyKWmQ9UWoJVf_fOJiNuIXa7Hr4zTggyhmSPl-2FIauNObvywzq7OxPdk6wW5ng1CNdqZRbZKXiXWG1aA4l-ZpKmK0j24mGSHEtiGm8CAGjlNr0iLEEkxppKzOir7j6_6yQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/WsptagY8wlLNc5IfxY4gZexn0BDb98GSd6Ojbudy16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/wlyq86"&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five things for this week. Oh and Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week I had &lt;strong&gt;Live Office hours&lt;/strong&gt; and we talked about Web3 for Entrepreneurs! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRa8xC9chk"&gt;Here is the full video&lt;/a&gt; where I cover Web3, best DAOs, what a DAO is and tons of other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/nMnAXvT59JImmAb4xX7C1Pm5eQ6Su0Sv80r2qyQn16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRa8xC9chk"&gt;Check the video here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In case you don't know, we have a DAO - called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;KaramelaDAO&lt;/a&gt;. On our twitter we talk about how we built our DAO and we have a DAO Historian that writes &lt;a href="https://mirror.xyz/karameladao.eth"&gt;once per week about the cool things that we build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/gJb2St9fMCb3P5TaOGxU1B706yEds2o54dnkfTf116325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to have a small community of 300 people that get to build interesting stuff and experiment with these new social structures. ]&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/rcMREKNA3X"&gt;Join us on our Discord if you want to check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_startups-founders-activity-6832905191004753920--LCW"&gt;When I first asked Entrepreneurs to send me their pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I'll review them, I had no idea I'll be doing YouTube videos for two months and have 600+ pitch decks in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the awesome part. Today I am happy to announce that I am an investor to one of the companies that I reviewed on my channel, &lt;a href="https://www.zenus.ai/"&gt;Zenus.AI&lt;/a&gt;. The pitch deck if you want to check it out is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUlE3gDqrvQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something even awesomer. Three investors reached out to me after watching the pitch deck and now they are also investors in Zenus.AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still &lt;a href="https://jon.io/startup-office-hours"&gt;send me your pitch deck here&lt;/a&gt; and I'll review it some time in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ DAOs are the hottest thing right now (&lt;a href="https://jon.io/becoming-a-genius-robots-in-preschools-and-daos-against-hedge-funds"&gt;as I have been saying for the last two months&lt;/a&gt;) mostly because they introduce new business metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a DAO to work, you need to have an MLC - a Minimum Lovable Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctt.ac/2CKFk"&gt;Click here to share it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do you really know what a DAO is and how they started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;new video&lt;/a&gt; that is "different" from my previous ones. I would love to hear what you think about it as I really like this style but definitely I need more work to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch it and tell me if it was captivating or if you got bored. I really want to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://%20https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;Watch it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Story time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban almost never invests in other people's funds because "he doesn't enjoy it" but he invested $6M in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Backstage_Cap"&gt;Backstage Capital&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1475879762895593472?t=6QGdkDK1GF60yg1Gn810NA&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;the founder asked him why&lt;/a&gt;, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re in rooms I’ll never be in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to make a 10x difference? Leave the room you are, either it is a town, country or company and &lt;strong&gt;be in the "future" room&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the highlights this week - oh and Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ In 6 hours from now, I will be having &lt;strong&gt;Live&lt;/strong&gt; Office hours on YouTube, talking about Web3, NFTs and DAOs answering your questions! Let me know if I should be doing more Live Office hours about Startups, Crypto and other futuristic topics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/vqdj8d"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; and then on the "Reminder on" button! It is going to be super fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u8CGr5rbrnun2QEHkhlKAOl6vQDdZKIK4A4ijAaKgDZdZcIQblz8969DpRnoBzhhuMJobqRafoyD7E2X_nZ3R_QMOeglzzZFVbCi9OOnfdsGzB7THDeVmgKrEtQN6_0xkM0Ofg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/nMnAXvT59JImmAb4xX7C1Pm5eQ6Su0Sv80r2qyQn16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/vqdj8d"&gt;This Live&lt;/a&gt; will be recorded, edited and posted some time in future but I highly suggest you watch it live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week I posted about $Victory coins and that whoever posts on social media "I am Victorious" and tags me is going to get 100 $Victory coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen you and I'll reach out in the next couple of weeks, asking for your Ethereum address to send you your coins. To the people that watched my previous videos and requested to send them a song, it is coming this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the people that found the "secret" messages on the videos, I've sent them a &lt;strong&gt;physical gift&lt;/strong&gt; but I have NO IDEA why it takes sooo much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 will have tons of surprises. Trust me on this. It is going to be beyond epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I found on Twitter, this AMAZING image with the 20+ Powerful Paradoxes of life. My favorite is the "Fear Paradox". Which one is yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PKnb89o5FDQtZeQlapf350_JcR0B4cUiby-tjYrjbndvOpNH9FdTnsOzblm6IungdtpkCu6acW9Yjz7MboVffrsaBEKgruwouKg95jnR1cbKZE8GuOSBUXmYxaV9SAC4Zf0Tkw=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/55FXEIhZcJbSRt5ZicFvxhsbrOZXg58xZlveib0T16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very successful Entrepreneur told me that she reads this once every week. It helps her regain focus and slow down. Maybe this is one of your New Year's Resolutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Jack (the founder of Twitter) got &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/xzdqrp"&gt;trashed on Twitter while venting for web3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YN1C_Ok7AcGiYbrA9RNH7j6i8t7AEorWimblER14HDG0mFT8boYon3KEOCUN2DUs06NkiK_CGWrMnWAum-Q6qzq2ukFypiI32qq8NslUURyUNRjw4v8BXaZa5yo-EpopEkNPww=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/XGzT0O3ZocX6IaGYkhix3tIwcEkYWdFGhKsQ0SiD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that he violated the first rule of Web3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community &amp;gt; VCs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of Web3 projects, no VC/Angel funding is needed. Actually it is a huge red flag. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that a Startup needs to do is &lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, fail. It took me a lot of time to get this into my mind as I was poisoned by my European mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/llq5n6"&gt;Building Startups to Fail&lt;/a&gt; means to do things that are not scalable. Things that will crash &lt;strong&gt;because you have too many customers&lt;/strong&gt;. And Web3 projects either have an insane amount of customers (that usually pay or can be monetized easily) or none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional funding model doesn't apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product market fit in Web3 means "printing money". Product market fit in Web2 is your first 100 (free) subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ In related news, the Twitch co-founder Justin Kan, after selling Twitch to Amazon for almost $1 Billion, he spent some time chilling and decided to enter the NFT space with a new Startup: &lt;strong&gt;Fractal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is very nice (selling NFTs as game assets) but not even &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/54zgyl"&gt;a week after the launch, $150k were stolen&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because blockchain development is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/gvkznx"&gt;tons of executives and engineers are leaving their $500k per year jobs to jump into web3&lt;/a&gt;. By now I should be sounding like a broken record :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many things happened last week and I cannot wait to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This week I gave a talk about DAOs at the "Proof Of Consciousness", a Los Angeles/Venice DAO. &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/jondao11"&gt;Here are the slides&lt;/a&gt; and I recorded an epic video - hopefully to be released this week. It explains once and for all what a DAO is and how you can start working for one. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;Subscribe on my Youtube channel to get a notification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/fLHbj583xA888gQNT2y9ACjxVybTxgqX37fZsrGH16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week I posted about the DAO that we started - KaramelaDAO. We are building it in public - meaning that everything that we do is documented and shared. Now you can learn from our mistakes and see the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and below is the first designs for our NFT. If you want to get involved (we have tons of bounties!), &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;drop by our Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/gJb2St9fMCb3P5TaOGxU1B706yEds2o54dnkfTf116325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week we didn't have a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;weekly pitch deck reviews&lt;/a&gt; but oh, this week you are in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hes-launching-a-new-media-company-with-its-own-social-media-platform"&gt;Donald Trump has started a new media(?) company&lt;/a&gt; that hopes to replace Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon, Stripe, Google Cloud, AWS and Azure. I am not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone sent me his pitch deck and ... (you know where this is going right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVWM00QjeY"&gt;I am reviewing Donald Trump's new pitch deck&lt;/a&gt;, without getting political, as I review every other single Startup. A lot of things to be learnt from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/9XwxSVcEKfw80xZx3iZOPnO69BNUoSUy1DBS4Nka16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVWM00QjeY"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ The last couple of months, my schedule grew back to its unsustainable form. Despite having outsourced almost &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; that is possible to be outsourced, I got involved again into to many epic projects. On top of that, there is a never-ending backlog with pitch deck reviews plus tons of other content waiting to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to $Victory coins (yes, I am working on the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You collect $Victory by reading my newsletters, by forwarding them, when you watch my YouTube videos until the end or have attended one of my talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can spent $Victory on pushing your pitch deck review higher on the list, get some &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; mentoring from me or redeem it with swag (NFT t-shirts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $Victory coins are using a new smart contract from &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;, so expect delays and bugs until everything is shortened out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag me on social media with the message "I want to be Victorious" and I'll send you 100 $Victory coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I have one last thing to say and it is not financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838901/reddit-going-public-sec-s-1-filing-confidential"&gt;Reddit is going public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week with (hopefully) some $Victory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Yesterday I gave a talk in &lt;a href="https://decentraland.org/"&gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt; about DAOs, &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; and the future …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Yesterday I gave a talk in &lt;a href="https://decentraland.org/"&gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt; about DAOs, &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; and the future of DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/oiaot0WcxrdulBUs3XRimSfJtxzhsPYrEIqMhMsp16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's my avatar in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't manage to attend (probably because you are not following me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) the highlights were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a strong cause behind what you do, people will join and help. It is not just about the money
Mistakes are bound to happen but as long as you made an informed decision, it is ok. You cannot predict the future and take into account unknown variables
Try to scale slowly. Going viral is most of the times a curse
Beware of the scammers. So many of them in the crypto space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I posted a couple of weeks ago about a DAO that we are building. We have a name (KaramelaDAO) and a vibrant community that is operating semi-autonomously. We do at least two community calls per week so if you are interested in learning more about DAOs, the Metaverse and how we can take over a Greek Island and elected our own representative, &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;drop by our Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;DAO on Twitter too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ The last couple of weeks, I keep hearing that working for a Web3 company is "dangerous". You can always be replaced on the spot or the company can fail and/or run out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Better.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better.com is a well funded company that has 1 billion dollars and last week the &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/12/08/business/better-executive-resignations/index.html"&gt;CEO fired 900 people during a Zoom call&lt;/a&gt;. On the spot. Like, hey Merry Christmas for those that are not on this call because &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; are fired. No reason. No explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in a DAO you get to keep your governance token and vote rights and kinda know about these kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Oh Elon Elon Elon. At first you loved getting government money to build cool stuff but the moment the word "union" was heard you started thrashing around about inflation and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1468684576407101440"&gt;about the incentives other companies get to also build cool stuff&lt;/a&gt;. But that's ok. I still love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want to believe that money and resourcefulness solve everything but it seems that &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/neuralink-tesla-have-an-ai-problem-elons-money-cant-solve"&gt;A.I needs something more than money&lt;/a&gt; and that means that we won't get &lt;a href="https://neuralink.com/"&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; any time soon or self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But weirdest things have happened so who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Talking about weird stuff, I always found super strange that whenever Christies was selling some SUPER expensive multimillion NFT, there was always something fishy happening (sales not recorded on the blockchain, no open prices etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, Christie decided to do some &lt;a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/christies-opensea-nft-sale-1234612759/amp/"&gt;sales directly on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it wasn't that impressive. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs were accused of being the perfect tool for money laundering but maybe there &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/"&gt;are more transparent that normal companies&lt;/a&gt; because of the huge community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week with possibly a surprise ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-- Jon V (as in Victory)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Newsletters"></category></entry><entry><title>Mr Beast is a beast and the crypto domination continues</title><link href="http://jon.io/mr-beast-is-a-beast-and-the-crypto-domination-continues" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-12-02T22:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-03-10T10:42:31-08:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ It has become a tradition by now, to have one &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; thing happening in the DAO space every week. This is the &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;fourth newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and trust me on this, I am not even talking about 1/64 of what is happening out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started helping out &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; with their Constitution smart contract and just like that I started another DAO, called DAOCracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of people helping out already, we had two community calls and I love it! If you want to participate and learn about web3, NFTs, the metaverse and how to work for a DAO, drop by our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; (channel #the-dao). I promise you, this DAO is for new people to learn more about this crazy new space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In the meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/el-salvador-plans-bitcoin-city-raise-1-billion-via-bitcoin-bond.html"&gt;El Salvador decided to create a "Bitcoin City"&lt;/a&gt; and raise $1 billion via "Bitcoin Bond". Translation: &lt;strong&gt;Scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no city being build that is not on the Ethereum blockchain and not using NFTs. Building a Bitcoin City makes as much sense as building a city using rocks. You can do it but you are probably an idiot. In this case, you cannot even build a city with Bitcoin as you cannot do any transactions and there are no smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ And we are back with our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;weekly pitch deck reviews&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am reviewing a pretty solid Startup, with a very impressive technology. If I could change only one thing in their pitch deck that would be ... (come on, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXduZ4VdXCs"&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/hodzT9gEL9Ep5E2YVegFMT2GzrWiuZKqE1OA2SsY16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXduZ4VdXCs"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ If you don't know Mr Beast, oh you are in for a surprise. An excellent creator, that creates super viral videos. His last video is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg"&gt;Squid Games&lt;/a&gt;. 135 Million views in 7 days. Yes, he had more viewers that the actual Squid games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to create viral content, study him (I know I am!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ The founder of Twitter left Twitter. But that's not the big news. Jack Dorsey is also the founder of Square (a huge fintech company) that is now &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/dorsey-led-square-rebrands-block-2021-12-01/"&gt;rebranding to Block&lt;/a&gt;. Yes Block as in &lt;strong&gt;Block&lt;/strong&gt;chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still working for a web2 company, you have to &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; reevaluate your choices. Join a DAO, and start reading as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a job in the future, you need to start working for the "future" - someone I don't remember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've been talking DAOs non-stop for the last three newsletters. And for a good reason because DAOs are the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week a &lt;a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/"&gt;DAO decided to buy a copy of the American Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to raise $47M &lt;strong&gt;in a week&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;They lost the auction&lt;/a&gt; to the founder and CEO of Citadel - one of the biggest hedge funds on the planet. But what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nvXtnQBggX-LXt8grO2n00LkeJkIYhuPtzMnPk66vLcERh31BYdzIssk9OhZy7QXnDkzIZwEht_utTb79m8GXzGTGCKAZJR_nQ1J63dsesFY84zt0RuyBJAtcOXMlGBu9IReqQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/1uIUdxGBQbVrdb55nP8L79fup8QqaLXgEwFL7djN16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAOs can mobilize people (and money) extremely fast - faster than we have ever seen. The reason is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is equal in the DAO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger companies feel threatened as they cannot retain talented people and are left with those who "play it safe". Every single VC (that worth its salt) has switched to funding "Web3" companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAOs pay better, are more fun to work with and provide more value than "web 2.0" companies. But of course there are downsides (which we'll talk about next week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week we had a &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; Los Angeles meetup. And it was epic. There I learnt about &lt;a href="https://mars.college/"&gt;Mars College&lt;/a&gt;, a Burning-Man-For-Hackers playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens there is that for three months, people that are creators, tinkers, thinkers, hackers and want to stretch their mind beyond the social norms, &lt;strong&gt;build a city&lt;/strong&gt;, create study groups and &lt;strong&gt;do deep work&lt;/strong&gt;. In the end of the "college", the city is torn down (like in Burning Man).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to rent a van and visit my friends in February, so if you want to come along just send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week I took a break from reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I started doing small videos answering questions that came from you. That's what I did again this week (I promise, next week I'll go back to reviewing your pitch decks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/zp82yz"&gt;I rant about NDAs&lt;/a&gt; and why you might seem as "not knowing what you are doing" if you ask one from investors. Take a look (it's a 2-minute epic video with Los Angeles as the background).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u0-JWQF3PGk0Cac0LegwXGSyMuN7KUmuoQz7g2fMsaIDEYaLu-e7J3SUt5_q45xlRkGmHNEUHXzojQROquz0xDJt54JpEoOYm-B2NqqPMdd3ndlbv88rpjT7qYdOxGaTbLVX1A=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/5nbwJB2xARLx1IU4hOqzml4nbxDnnErczzZgGn2g16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/zp82yz"&gt;Click here to see the epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ South Korea is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/jqvxoz"&gt;experimenting with small robots&lt;/a&gt; in pre-schools. Yes, you are in the Kindergarten and you are given a small robot in order to familiarize yourself with the future technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't start saying "when I was in the Kindergarten I used to run all day and play with my friends" because I am not stupid. Offering &lt;strong&gt;more knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deeper&lt;/strong&gt; understanding gives you an advantage. Like teaching your kids chess. Or a musical instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; more complex than the past. It is just moves faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I heard many times that I am a talented Entrepreneur, engineer or singer (ok, I've never heard the singer part). And whenever I say that "it is mostly hard work", I get the eyeroll. Here is an interesting story that proves that &lt;strong&gt;you are what you dedicate time on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, a psychologist decided to see if you are born a (chess) genius or you can become one. And he did what every normal person does: &lt;strong&gt;he put an ad to find a women to bear a child for him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as all love stories go, he found one. And they had three girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to teach all girls how to play chess. Oh an important part of the story: himself &lt;strong&gt;was not&lt;/strong&gt; a chess prodigy/genius/grandmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short the three girls, without having in their "DNA" the genius chromosome, they became chess prodigies and two of them are the first and second best chess players in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he had a trick to do that. A very simple trick. Deep, non-stop hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you find excuses, remember that is &lt;strong&gt;all you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/2yg52d"&gt;Read the story here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ The majority of people around us haven't been conditioned into taking action. That's why they have a hard time understanding what separates a good decision from a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yBm865Hw2k3wqSMFQ0D8NuygFzCqZDZ84TZt11dDI5En9D_bQGi51NjOP4fR_NlFwZ62dRcxmmJGa85I3SzRRIIe6NqX-lyfTgPiwUNQT-VHzjsafZBN8l6SmWJRw2pQ3bP6OA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/vnMHP1cRGbd4BNUq15aUUrfOhTFZlhwd4l7wT2rD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision that takes a lot of time will end up in &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/p8ydlv"&gt;Analysis Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision that tries to gather all data, it might no longer be beneficial as the landscape moves. Successful investments are done only with 20% of available information - before everybody else finds out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making decisions is more than data/facts collection. It is about &lt;strong&gt;execution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have this in the back of your mind when you try to find your next move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/54nlyq"&gt;Crypto Cities&lt;/a&gt; and more specifically about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/zp70oj"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; (disclosure: I am affiliated with CityDAO). A week ago, we were 6000 Citizens planning how to build software to create a new city. This week we are 10k Citizens - and no more Citizens will be accepted at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am excited about DAOs is that I am working on launching a new DAO about the Metaverse and Web3. I am looking for names and if you come up with one, you'll get a free "citizenship".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be involved - drop by my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/p8yd0v"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and join the channel #TheDao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ This week I took a break from reviewing &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5g8q"&gt;pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I started doing small videos answering questions that came from you. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/xz62rn"&gt;Here is the first one&lt;/a&gt; (and one of my favorites). If you have any questions, reply to this email and I'll (probably) do a small video about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/4LvDNgWCUsEVbLmfkY036dRKIIH3H298WJIXx174HZjPyDCESc_rTw6oSsfEe3LTLa3_OXtvqm9pUd2uONqPtro9UFOIuf4knaYjyG9J1VNlN0cICmF0fGKai5F-lwD0T0fUxA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/ReCeXGgaIwqpjdk6uZrQXzAnJOJYXVTtrgG40szZ16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/xz62rn"&gt;Click here to see this epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A couple weeks ago, I asked all of you to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/ll2rvp"&gt;help out with selling the domain house.new&lt;/a&gt;. I have three offers but they are a bit complicated. I'll wait a couple weeks before deciding. If you have a small Startup and you can use the domain, you can get it at a huge discount - just to irritate Zillow, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5rwq"&gt;that is having a terrible week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ If you are &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/2y9pj6"&gt;watching my videos&lt;/a&gt;, you should know that I include hidden gems for those who are observant. In one of them I said at the end of the video "if you are watching this, I'll send you something interesting".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone that saw the hidden gem and reached out to me, you'll be getting a hardcopy of one of my favorite books "How To Live" that was released a couple months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nLR9i8AdInH2TfNDo3HMHgThlurpYhQeWV3nHj5Z-G9d0WD7F9A_Uwh-mtXSUYy5kpSGZ_oJ80UPP2E6pWz1QAXMwllCs7pwXw0_CCRtBkKso8Nm0Z2PNfLH_XGj1CG48BoOng=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/keiFw86LVaSRoz4OskC4rTlwZ8UHCgBJhiblCKCk16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I like sending people physical items is that I like having a real connection. When you get a physical item - especially a book - you create conversations and bonds stronger than just words on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as you know, I always respond to anyone that sends me an email - that's why I am doing this newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I talked about the Metaverse many times and I even had &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/qwpez6"&gt;my own Metaverse conference&lt;/a&gt; last summer but the space is getting crazy hot. Facebook (or should I say Meta?) will &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/k02oly"&gt;release haptic gloves&lt;/a&gt; so we can punch each other, China will &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5req"&gt;integrate Metaverse with reality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/gve242"&gt;Roblox&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite companies - disclosure: I am an investor) went up 30% in a day as more brands wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and Nike is preparing &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/695yoe"&gt;a new Metaverse, NFTs and cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; benefit from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are experiencing one of the biggest wealth creation events in the human history. It's one of the few times where having deep knowledge of a subject and being able to provide/create value can change your life and the life of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just "Web-3", it is "Internet-2"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start reading about DAOs, NFTs, how you can participate, how they work, how this new world operates and what are the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/09qx6q"&gt;It is crazy right now but it is going to get crazier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I am reviving the "Algorithms Pay My Bills" Community on &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to drop by and chit-chat, you are more than welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;Metaverse Cities&lt;/a&gt;. What I haven't told you is that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;Metaverse Cities&lt;/a&gt;. What I haven't told you is that I am a Citizen of the &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt;. CityDAO has bought real land in Wyoming and a community of 6k+ citizens is planning to build a whole city. Seems that the Metaverse is clashing with reality pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am excited about DAOs is that I am working on launching a new DAO about the Metaverse and Web3. If you want to be involved - drop by &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;my Discord&lt;/a&gt; and join the channel #TheDao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In my latest &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/e84rop"&gt;pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about what most investors look in a pitch deck. Hint: It is money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RBMqw_0ljR2vHuK2hsfHmkOrLEfWsMAROV74XpCYKeFDZPTzyiLh581dp-0GyP22nPzh49N3t4NObPxFt8hr8MN5wjNhVZmQPPGMH6FbtLEQNQsisbLEeT8SR_CDbSTbjdKD-w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/6JqdpM2IKdGOqIXCkQDwmQYvpiCdyhdIgDICV3jP16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/e84rop"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I've invested in a lot of DAOs and "not traditional" companies but one of them will blow your mind with their business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a crypto game called &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/84204r"&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, valued at $3 Billion and got funding from the biggest VCs on the planet. To participate in that game you need to buy their NFTs and then by playing you can earn money - this is called Play-to-Earn (P2E).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is mind blowing is that you can invest in a "company" that buys the NFTs and "rents" them out to players in countries like the Philippines. These players play all day long, win money and they "profit-share" with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you still haven't got it, you can have your own e-Sports team, running fully decentralized and autonomously, earning money while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/k0y7qj"&gt;Here is a video to see more about this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Netflix is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/p8ovgd"&gt;expanding to games&lt;/a&gt;. You will be able to buy and play games using your Netflix subscription. It seems that all companies at the moment became game companies and then add NFTs. I wonder if anyone is still building non-Entertainment products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I am reviving the "Algorithms Pay My Bills" Community on &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to drop by and chit-chat, you are more than welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many exciting things happened last week (I won't even discuss about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/vq6krd"&gt;Facebook changing their name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;) so let's jump right into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many exciting things happened last week (I won't even discuss about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/vq6krd"&gt;Facebook changing their name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;) so let's jump right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've been working towards building a "real" Metaverse. That means a city, with its &lt;strong&gt;own physical language&lt;/strong&gt;, currency and a DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Αλγοκρατία (Algocracy) is a type of Democracy where instead of Demos (the public) holding (crato/krato) the laws, we have algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of the Metaverse and not 3d avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/k0kgdy"&gt;Click here to share it on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seems that is the next steps as &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/742v6l"&gt;Metacities are started to get formed&lt;/a&gt;. What a crazy world we live in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in helping out, reply to this email and I'll keep you in the loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/69wwze"&gt;In my latest pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about why you need a CTO and why you shouldn't scale prematurely. As my personal motto goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it to fail, not to scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LxyS5acjdrGtjvJmaHwBPvOXvPJiDmXftTE5S6cMxnjO7kAAgUfIFcQs7Wej8dFTVt7GbHYFHJBou9-zi8nIMngMNvmUDA6DUFVnWHDzLLZPBhJCts83LrHWKanqj0EIhynrYg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/mafGqKDYXjqj6iDQoJc4Xn33SFM2QAClst5IcVDE16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ The most common misconceptions for success are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) You need to be smart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) You need to be rich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) You need to be talented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can guarantee you that if &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/op6649"&gt;someone like me&lt;/a&gt; can do it then everyone can. And I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that helped me in building insanely competitive companies, destroying competition, making crazy investments (sometimes with 300x return) or identifying new markets long before the majority (like Ethereum at $8) are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) You should have no issue with failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to fail = Learn to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destroy your ego if you want to make a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/xz0029"&gt;Share this on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Learn how to become &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/qwnneg"&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;. It is impossible not to have your ass beaten so learn how to become like water - powerful but never rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Get better at storytelling. If you cannot inspire people, if you cannot make them dream, it doesn't make what you are building. Take lessons, start writing small stories even blog posts and get better at storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Commit. Do you want a perfect body? Commit to diet and exercise. Do you want to build wealth? Commit to hard work. Do you want love? Commit to improving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple but not easy instructions ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I am planning to release the third version of &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/dpzz70"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;, the NFT Marketplace that I started by accident. But I am going to do this in public!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a movement called #buildinpublic where you build your product "in the open", for everyone to see. You share the good times and the bad times. And I like it because it helps more people to see that Startups are not overnight successes but hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an amazing infographic by &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/84xxl2"&gt;manceraio&lt;/a&gt; that can help you launch your Startup - if you want to try out the #buildinpublic movement ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/oeBR5CoTr340IWYcogZ4RMk9RV84Crf1m4H_ur7zUFqD5Z3y_X5Tvx19Y6f1oMUbZGBV3w3DWhYcR2x7RjsYewB8kMTGKkIgG2fp391kG9Klly3Oy5PKbsiR4br1y0dlFCr11w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/bW8CwS6KhzdB2n6dGnLXZQZO3udV8gDtnc9oCBA716325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ There is a new kind of domain, the &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/xz00y9"&gt;".new"&lt;/a&gt;. These are called "the shortcuts of the web". For example, if you go to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/84xxl8"&gt;docs.new&lt;/a&gt;, a new Google Doc will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I bought the house.new domain because I think that companies (like Zillow) will love to have this domain. But instead of just selling it, I want to try an experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can find a buyer for house.new, you get 20% of the final price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that simple. You find a buyer (let's say $10k), the buyer gets it and you get $2k (or whatever it is after fees). The highest price by next Thursday, gets the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And this is where things become interesting&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of me spending these money on surfboards, I will place the money in a DAO that will hire people (maybe you?) to do more tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is that this DAO, becomes self-sustained, grows its capital thus making everyone a shareholder, decision-maker, employee and employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I posted on LinkedIn a question: What tricks do you know to sell products more efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/7IbbWPotOF0n3s5JMUwWG8Kwjdie7g2hbt6z4LWi16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cool comments were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Never say that you are better than a competitor - companies have already done their due diligence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) B2B Software selling, it's 70% side-by-side solution architecture, 20% empathising, and 10% team character. If you reached into the point of the funnel that you have a call/meting, you don't have to "sell".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Don't freeze or stutter on the cost question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more comments &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_one-thing-i-learnt-as-an-entrepreneur-trying-activity-6859087531116494848-kxz7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and if we are not connected on Linkedin, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnvlachoyiannis/"&gt;we should&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let jump to the top five things that happened last 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Today Facebook will be announcing its Metaverse plans. But wait wait wait. If you haven't seen &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/watch-facebooks-metaverse-musical-about-open-enrollment-for-benefits.html"&gt;Facebook's official metaverse musical about employees&lt;/a&gt; you are missing out. It is sooo cringeworthy and internet is going nuts about the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In my &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vS3EXCXkZnY"&gt;latest pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about academics trying to build products and Startups. The video has already created very heated discussions as my point of view is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;building stuff &amp;gt; talking about stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video I talk about why it might hurt your chances raising money if you have taken money for your Startup from a government (or the European union) or why it might be negative if you have any scientific papers about your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/dFT40SmMpqjZja8nWnRyYh86PIjWTQFJo3jp88Im16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vS3EXCXkZnY"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Having said that, Ryan Petersen put the glasses on every single Operations researcher/scientist in LA and universities got offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port of LA/Long Beach is at a standstill. That means shipments are not making their way around California, the US and even the whole world. It is a gridlock, an operational mayhem. What Ryan did? &lt;strong&gt;He rented a boat and inspected the operations as close as he could&lt;/strong&gt;. He identified the easiest thing to fix that would solve 90% of the issue and posted his solution on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When you're designing an operation you must choose your bottleneck. If the bottleneck appears somewhere that you didn't choose it, you aren't running an operation. It's running you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people start improving on the idea and shared it with the Mayor of Long Beach, Robert Garcia. &lt;strong&gt;And OMG, it was actually implemented! AND IT WORKS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/DaXp7SlpYFsC4Iqjji5IoqOzvt6Sv8j4UKKixp3D16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ A crypto collective - a DAO - bought from the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/PTzSIYe6LbNW55i_Jo4S_fgqIiDp3d7YblpikQ1iRks"&gt;Wu-Tang Clan’s unreleased album&lt;/a&gt;, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for &lt;strong&gt;$4M&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me break it down for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu-Tang Clan's unreleased album was bought by a hedge fund manager that went to jail for fraud for seven years. Department of Justice got custody of the album. And this is where things become interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/XUTAIVjPcKB0xoV8mwcm9ppXcrLPbKs7EvyJOnO316325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of people have formed a DAO to buy collectible NFTs. The name of the DAO is &lt;a href="https://pleasr.org/"&gt;PleasrDAO&lt;/a&gt; and they have bought some very interesting NFTs in the past. Long story short, they went to DOJ and said that we want to buy that album for $4M and ... boom! &lt;strong&gt;They are now the only people on the planet that have heard this album and have the rights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ The first trillion is always the hardest. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/20/spacex-could-make-elon-musk-world-first-trillionaire-says-morgan-stanley"&gt;Elon Musk is on his way to become the first trillionaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember all these financial analysts claiming that the internet is a fad, a bubble? How many huge enterprises shutdown for being to stiff to "go with the wave", how many people missed out on a big "wealth transfer event"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening again with the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can scream and shout that crypto and NFTs are a scam but reality doesn't care about anyone's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/J1JVxJiGSJb9M733MiPsBKVyDLbE3HoktOB01lfr16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things you need to know about the "new reality":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;Facebook will be changing its name&lt;/a&gt; and will hire more than 10000 people to build the Metaverse (or at least Facebook's version of Metaverse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all building their Metaverse trying to capture as much of the &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/"&gt;"Web3"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I wrote an article about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/five-reasons-why-you-cannot-sell-your-nfts"&gt;why you cannot sell your NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't know how to make your NFTs, this is another article &lt;a href="https://jon.io/create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;how to do it for free&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't know what an NFT is, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;here is a small intro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/MrD4oUk9LSWvj4oiYzWXKfFMGHaoWaNYfo5IebHH16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of the work, the future of companies and the heart of a Metaverse is a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/?sh=7b3a8bd7305f"&gt;DAO&lt;/a&gt;. A DAO is a bunch of algorithms that define the operations/rules of a company/team/country and people are responsible for the governance (by voting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a DAO can have 1000 members where all have chipped in to buy self-driving cars. These self-driving cars will be rented out, recharge on their own and the profits will go back to the DAO. A DAO can also hire people and pay them as a normal company. The difference is that all decisions are made by anonymous, fully remote citizens and are enforced by algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://flamingodao.xyz/"&gt;FlamingoDAO&lt;/a&gt; buys and sells NFTs. 1hive hires people to build projects that make more money for the DAO. &lt;a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/"&gt;OlympusDAO&lt;/a&gt; builds fully financial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DAO doesn't need an HR department. You pick up any task you want, you complete it, it gets reviewed and you get your money. There are a lot of people working on one or multiple DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Ok, let's take a breather because this was A LOT of information. One thing I learnt as an Entrepreneur trying to sell products to big customers is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-to-make-consumers-dissatisfied-with-a-product-tell-them-a-better-version-is-coming-11634752462"&gt;NEVER say that a new version&lt;/a&gt; or a new feature is coming out soon. You give them a "way out" to postpone their decision. You cannot come back from someone saying "oh, that's exciting! let's talk back when this feature is out".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I recorded another &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nUlE3gDqrvQ"&gt;Pitch Deck review&lt;/a&gt; and people are already interested in investing in this company. Check it out - a very good pitch deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/GvX6Jiemel8mTnvsaOYxN6f3YuTVE8fZ9CIbaEpI16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I learnt so many new cool stuff that I don't think one email can do justice. But I'll try. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I am having a blast with my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;"Startup Office Hours" channel&lt;/a&gt;. This week …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another crazy Friday (or Saturday depending on your time zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I learnt so many new cool stuff that I don't think one email can do justice. But I'll try. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I am having a blast with my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;"Startup Office Hours" channel&lt;/a&gt;. This week I reviewed another pitch deck (link here) and I believe my editing skills have improved tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I started doing these videos are to help as many Entrepreneurs as I can but also to learn a new skill: &lt;strong&gt;Visual Storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any feedback (seriously &lt;em&gt;ANY&lt;/em&gt; feedback helps) on things that can be improved just reply to this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/J7Eis1MdJok4slky2IC43Y9acwK9xq1KjiO82Zaj16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvf5eaLzFys"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I have been included in the &lt;strong&gt;100 Greek Innovators&lt;/strong&gt;. The article is in Greek but in short it says "Jon you are awesome".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/M50ODu7A5v6iHcq7iesdUCZBJOby93sKFwF6PFdY16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was five years ago, I wouldn't stop talking about it. Currently the only person that tracks all these is my mother (and sometimes puts them into frames).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that I consider myself a "big deal" but these don't give me an endorphin hit anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of time I found what gives me that hit: &lt;strong&gt;building stuff&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day that I build something (could be a site, a video, even a post), I feel great. Strange feeling and I have no idea why this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago &lt;a href="https://jon.io/maximize-what-you-love-minimize-what-you-hate"&gt;I wrote a post about it&lt;/a&gt; so maybe it can help you find your endorphin highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I cannot send an email and not include NFTs. Seriously, if you have no idea what NFTs, DAO and Blockchain mean, drop everything you do and start reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a post about NFTs and &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-nfts-will-change-events-and-why-mark-cuban-is-a-genius"&gt;why Mark Cuban is a genius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ The Squid game. There are going to be &lt;strong&gt;zero spoilers&lt;/strong&gt; so you are good if you haven't watched it yet (but do, it is awesome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/qgOfqtoFAQRismmq3qouvRrIUaDnMNpoC9eL7ZH216325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Squid game is the top show in 40 countries - and on its way to be Netflix's biggest show. It made an insane amount of money. But the script was &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/squid-game-script-was-rejected-for-10-years"&gt;rejected 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in its local market (Korea). What do we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment. If you believe on something, go for it. Life is not for playing it safe but for making a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big contributors of course are timing and location. This show might have been "too brutal" 10 years ago but now it is on "family airtime". And Netflix saw that the US will love a show like this and then the rest of the world will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I am surprised that most people are still working 9-5 without at least knowing about the &lt;a href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/"&gt;"ladder of wealth"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/EMWwFmrh1KyOmyH07t54e7Xb7bVtUKfcffyGk2q816325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/"&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt;, Barry talks about how you should progress from selling your time to selling products. This is a MUST READ even if you never plan to be an Entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

I am almost back to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger"&gt;scheduling meetings like Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. And that's a cool thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your inbox is not a todo list that everyone on the planet can add tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make an impact, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; need to prioritize. Emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that sprinkle of wisdom (damn, that's a cool name for a song), here are the 5 epic things I learnt this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, reply to this email and tell me your epic thing you learnt this week and I'll include it in the next email. How cool is that! Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Another &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sfFOumJZo"&gt;Pitch Deck review&lt;/a&gt; is out and this time is about an eCommerce Startup. Excellent flow and solid progress. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/X05amsQKelXqw20gsn9bjHvOKnd7oQwF6YJiAg0B16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sfFOumJZo"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I think I figured out how to go viral on Instagram and it is annoying. Oh, it is very annoying. With a 7 second video, I got 42k likes (and still going up) and 400k views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how I did it (I plan to run a couple more experiments so &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;follow me on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; if you want to be annoyed by the experiments):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) The most important thing is to include music in your post. Trending music. Instagram and Tik Tok prioritize posts with popular music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) No more photos. Videos. Short videos. Up to 10 - 15 seconds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. Experiment and play around. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT-CLhKpLXM/"&gt;post is here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I talked with a new Entrepreneur last week and she told me that she is terrified about how people will perceive her work. And by people I don't only mean customers but also friends and family. I told her what I tell to everyone in my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;free Startup course&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fail fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media amplified the success stories and all of a sudden everyone thinks that you can hit all the shots you take and if you don't, there is something wrong with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have something important to tell you and it is not that a lot of people fail. It is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody. Cares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster you realize this, the faster your life will improve and you can focus on things that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I keep getting so many questions about NFTs and whether are gambling or not. Here is an article about how an &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nft-evolved-apes-scam/"&gt;NFT creator run off with almost $3M&lt;/a&gt;. And it is not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New technologies create new opportunities to make money fast and lose money faster. That doesn't mean that you should be blind. You should read as much as you can about this new exciting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an article I wrote about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;trading NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Now that &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/seinfeld-netflix-episodes-cropped-widescreen-ratio"&gt;Seinfeld is on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, it's a good time to watch this video on how &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWxXyCfW5s"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld writes a joke&lt;/a&gt; and the-now-famous &lt;a href="https://nickwignall.com/seinfeld-strategy/"&gt;method of kicking ass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week I started reviewing Pitch decks that Startups are sending to me. I am already on the 3rd video and I think it is gets better and better. I would love it if you check it out and give me some feedback (and if you like &amp;amp; subscribe I'll give you a virtual high five!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X__PJmLnUAk"&gt;Check it out here&lt;/a&gt; (and find the hidden gems in the video ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/youtube/robo.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last year, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country"&gt;I helped a whole country to fight COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. It was crazy how much difference a single person can make. The biggest misconception is that we cannot make a change. I am here to tell you, that you - yes, YOU - can create and shape the world if you put your mind into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA (the Machine Learning Platform that analyzed thousands of tourists), just made it into Nature. Yes, the biggest scientific magazine in the world. Which is crazy! Hopefully this work will inspire more people to build cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I started training how I breathe - because how &lt;a href="https://jon.io/you-are-breathing-wrong"&gt;we are breathing is wrong&lt;/a&gt;. I plan to post some more articles about biohacking and how you can improve your performance and reduce your stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/82069/snoop-dogg-buys-xcopy-ethereum-nft-for-3-9-million"&gt;Snoop Dogg bought this image for $3.9M&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the NFT space is still going strong. What, still not convinced? Twitter seems to be also adding NFTs to their platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/zZ65ikYpA0JWElypb10LTuem75N0MO9GX411EKoZ16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Amazon released a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-523/"&gt;$999 robot&lt;/a&gt; that "runs" around your house. And a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;$250 drone&lt;/a&gt; that flies inside your house. And Facebook released a &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/culture-columns/article/Facebook-Ray-Ban-sunglasses-Drew-Magary-16497129.php"&gt;pair of glasses&lt;/a&gt;. If you are wondering why, the answer is simple: Data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, right to the chase (in Greece we say "right to the cooked meat").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've started &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn2w-ZYozDU"&gt;"Office Hours"&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, where I review Startups &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you want to learn from others or you have an idea to review, check the detailed post right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/youtube/fintechstartup.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ The first &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT5fBcYPw9T/"&gt;NFT fashion line&lt;/a&gt; will go live pretty soon. If you have any idea about fashion (or lines :D), I would love to pick your brain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/MDjkUQ9XsQCnCTzoIHyxrsXS32skasumkMlxkdmG16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I read in one sitting Derek's new book &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/h"&gt;"How to Live"&lt;/a&gt;. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is a small but condensed book of knowledge and you'll keep re-reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-weekly-mailchimp-uber-ron-klain-9-2021"&gt;Mailchimp got acquired for $12 Billion&lt;/a&gt; and the employees got Zero (with a capital Z). The founders walked away with $5 Billion each. Remember: getting a salary gets you through the day, getting equity gets you through a life (I don't even know if that makes sense, I just came up with it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ SEC moves aggressively towards crypto by forcing Coinbase to drop their &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/"&gt;lending product&lt;/a&gt;. The real question is whether the US (and subsequently the whole world) will embrace crypto or outlaw it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;
