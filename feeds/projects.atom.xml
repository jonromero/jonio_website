&lt;p&gt;I hate long distance running. It is stupid, boring and not fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate long distance running. It is stupid, boring and not fun at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who doesn't want to run TWO Marathon (and a Half Marathon) in one year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason I did that, was because I wanted to run the Authentic/Classic Marathon in Athens/Greece. And it was an amazing experience running the same route (from the city of Marathon to Athens) to the iconic stadium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/done.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who doesn't like flying for a week to Greece and back to LA?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I did &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; training (yes, I have an EVEN better program) and went &lt;strong&gt;way faster in a more difficult&lt;/strong&gt; (20 miles hills!) distance. Keep reading, I'll share everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, some stats:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I run more than half marathon every week, for a whole year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/wholeyear.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a lot of training to run a marathon (actually two marathons).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Instead of running 500 miles in training (the recommended), I run 300 miles (even less than the previous time - 320). But I did something different that I think is vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/runless.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before my long run, I always did a 6 mile run. That way, I was "pre-training" my legs and the total milage for two days was a little bit bigger. This helped A LOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ This Marathon felt easier. I recovered faster and the whole experience was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped that I had friends during the recovery!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/runningf.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I gained fat, lost muscle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running sucks as we have established. My next project is competing in a body building competition and it was impossible to make it work. Running needs a lot of energy. Take the &lt;strong&gt;L&lt;/strong&gt; and do some strength training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OIjTL3fHO_lxoR9dRxNFt_QyjwKsLKANRX6CoziH2oU/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;This is my training program&lt;/a&gt;. Worked for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6/ I had a CRAZY injury on my heels, a week before the race. But everything worked out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7/ Second year wearing Nike Vaporfly. Don't buy anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to keep running with Venice Run Club and the "Wind like the Run" every Wed and Sat and maybe a half Marathon for the fun of it but I think I am done with the full Marathon. The training is just brutal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next goal, body building! Follow along!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="projects"></category></entry><entry><title>My 13 year project - Until It Is Done</title><link href="http://jon.io/my-13-year-project-until-it-is-done" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-25T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T22:12:31-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My whole life is made of dreams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest one was to move to Silicon Valley. I knew it the moment I found myself in San Francisco with my Startup, walking on Main Street and seeing the tall buildings. Of course, there was zero chances of me making it as I was one of the million people wanting to be there. I had no money, no VISA and my Startup was running out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="San Francisco" src="images/sf.jpg" width='500px' &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But somehow (hard work? luck?) I made it. My Startup got acquired and I moved to San Francisco, with a big bank account and a bigger salary (7 digits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a new dream came up. &lt;strong&gt;I want to learn how to fly a plane&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was driving with my motorcycle more than 1 hour in traffic to get to the airport to get lessons. For a whole year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a new dream bubbled up. I want to do another company. And after that another dream and another. Crazier and more random than the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cleaning Cessna in San Carlos" src="images/planecessna.jpg" width='500px' &gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's how the birth of my ever-expanding bucket list—where crossing off one item adds three more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about financial independence is that you can do &lt;strong&gt;whatever&lt;/strong&gt; you want. However, what nobody really talks about is that sometimes you're left unsure about what to do next. You have too many options. It's similar to deciding where to go for dinner and someone says, 'We can go wherever you want.' Just pick a place bro!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my experience after achieving financial independence. I ventured into startups, sold them, and realized I didn't want to deal with VCs and raising money anymore. I simply wanted to pursue things I truly enjoyed. Yet, that wasn't as simple as it sounded due to the abundance of options. So, I decided to create a bucket list—a compilation of all the things I wanted to do. Surprisingly, the more I did, the more I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bucket list is a work in progress, with a timeline of 13 years. Why 13 years? It's arbitrary, but it serves as a deadline to ensure I make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I am 55 years old, I anticipate shifting focus to less physically demanding pursuits, like going into space, climbing mountain Everest or writing a book. This timeline not only guides my actions but also helps me prioritize based on both time and physical capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here is my &lt;strong&gt;never-ending Giga Startup&lt;/strong&gt;. I will try to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;document as much as I can&lt;/a&gt; and maybe I can inspire you to do things that you &lt;strong&gt;never thought you could&lt;/strong&gt;. Because if I could do it, TRUST me, anyone can.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="projects"></category></entry><entry><title>I made an A.I short movie - and it is crazy</title><link href="http://jon.io/i-made-an-ai-short-movie-and-it-is-crazy" rel="alternate"></link><published>2023-10-26T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T22:12:31-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;h2&gt;Good stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a "movie" in 5 hours and I spent &lt;strong&gt;$50&lt;/strong&gt; while being amateur in movie making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For someone like me, to have a similar result without A.I, they would need to spend at least $3k and 48 hours. At least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone spent more time and knew what they were doing, just by using A.I they could had made a short movie that the non-A.I equivalent would have been at least $50k and 1 week of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is that the benefits are exponential once you start using A.I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the &lt;strong&gt;bad news&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bad stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is EXTREMELY difficult to create scenes with the same character. If you watch my movie, you'll see that the main character keeps changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also very difficult to create exactly the shots that you want. I kept changing my script because I couldn't get the right shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out some videos &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonromero/status/1716224203148648709"&gt;I posted on twitter&lt;/a&gt;. Hilarious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.I is terrible when it comes to human faces that have to show emotions. Just terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating scripts with A.I is laughable. Plot holes, unimaginative stories, confusing endings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, I plan to create a big movie just to try more technologies (like lip syncing) as I believe the space is going to be huge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, let me present you with &lt;a href="https://heyfire.co/"&gt;HeyFire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision for changing the name (again) was not random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/track.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After talking with users, I figured out that it is best to lean more into the FIRE crowd as the app resonates better with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's talk more about HeyFire&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HeyFire helps you build financial portfolios by making it trivial to use prebuild and well-tested ones.
It also let's you experiment with different ideas, just by pressing some buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/screen1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also helps you with "tracking and acting" - meaning it suggests optimizations - while showing you how your portfolio might be impacted if a crash happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/screen2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can also share, compare and discuss with other people any ideas you might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/screen3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://heyfire.co"&gt;The site is up and you can register to try it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Fire stands for &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;inancial &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ndependence - &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;etire …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You know what takes the most time when building a Startup? Finding the freaking name &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; an available domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I hired some amazing designers and engineers and we brainstormed around a financial product with the code name &lt;strong&gt;HelloFire&lt;/strong&gt;. Fire stands for &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;inancial &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;ndependence - &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;etire &lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;arly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/domainame.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved that name and I even got the domain &lt;em&gt;hellofire.co&lt;/em&gt; - the .com was crazy expensive and I'll never pay tons of money for a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the story doesn't end here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got distracted by another project of mine &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt; - (come on, admit it, it is a great name) and I paused HelloFire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMGDrops got acquired so after 15 months (based on the last git commit), I decided to continue playing around with HelloFire but it seems I never renewed my domain. That means that now, I have to find a new name - and to tell you the truth, HelloFire wasn't very descriptive of what I was building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Five Steps to pick a great domain name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I always do when I am picking a new name for a product and domain (name reveal in the end!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will never pay a premium for a domain. I will add some word like "hello, hq, awesome" etc. Example: &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/"&gt;basecamphq.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a positive person (check my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; to see for yourself) and I always try to make my products positive and fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more serious the sector, the funnier the name I pick. This is a double-edge sword of course but I love marketing that is contrarian and I hate boring products. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not pick a "smart" name that relies on a pun. My first company (that got acquired by Splunk) was first called Sfalma (DO NOT ASK WHY OR WHAT IT MEANS) and we rebranded it to BugSense (we were an error reporting product).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make marketing's life easier by picking a name that could create a lot of interesting scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe all these instructions seem too generic so below is my thoughts process when I try to find a new product name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding a new name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any domains that contain the word &lt;strong&gt;invest&lt;/strong&gt;, are immediately disqualified. Same with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of them are too boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get some inspiration, I start looking at titles of famous investment books. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/investor.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could play around with &lt;em&gt;intelligent&lt;/em&gt; but it is a very long word. Let's find &lt;a href="https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/intelligent"&gt;synonyms online&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/syno.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wise&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;whiz&lt;/em&gt; draw my attention but &lt;strong&gt;wise&lt;/strong&gt; is a bit tame and &lt;strong&gt;whiz&lt;/strong&gt; I don't like the &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; in the end. But I like the vibe.
I decide to follow whiz and I end with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wonder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;star&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of products with &lt;strong&gt;Wonder&lt;/strong&gt; in their name so I decided to research &lt;strong&gt;star&lt;/strong&gt; a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Star has some color in it and some movement and it is a bit playful. Let's save it for now and head back to looking at book titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/richdad.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like where this is going. It is descriptive and most of our audience has heard about it. By the way, your domain name doesn't have to be exactly the name of your product!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I kept looking around books, I saw this and it took me to a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/outliers.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your product name and especially your domain &lt;strong&gt;has&lt;/strong&gt; to evoke something about your brand. In my case, I am building a product that helps people create wealth by following strategies that are suited for their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember also another book from the same author: &lt;em&gt;David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants&lt;/em&gt; that is even close to the vibe I like. My product has a lot of community involved so misfits, underdogs are not bad ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/goliath.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I want to remove a little bit from the anger that these words carry. Let's save outliers and misfits and keep looking for inspiration in book titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some ideas, let's try to imagine our product as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Customer persona&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ideal customer is someone that cares a lot about their financials and they are always on the lookout for new opportunities to build wealth. They might have gotten burnt in the past by listening to people that have NO idea what are they talking about (hint:  people with money usually don't know how to manage their wealth) and they hope that they can add a little bit of &lt;strong&gt;data&lt;/strong&gt; in their decisions. They are explorers. They are hustlers. Builders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full product is going to cost $499 per year (accurate price pending) so I assume that my customers have a considerable amount in investable assets.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanding the search&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am stuck and I decided to expand my search to memes - taking it even further from how traditional financial products approach their audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I google: money memes and some golden results come up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fuck you money (a saying from the FIRE community)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show me the money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it rain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memes are a great part of my growth strategy and it fits in my customer persona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, &lt;strong&gt;ShowMeTheMoney&lt;/strong&gt; is a fantastic domain but not available. What if we change it to Show me &lt;strong&gt;YOUR&lt;/strong&gt; money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bingo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following domains are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showmeyourmoney.app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;showmeyourmoney.co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like it. It is playful (show me your money) and people get that it is about a wealth tracking app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the question is to use the .app as the main domain or the .co? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to read more about how I am building HelloFire (oh sorry) ShowMeYourMoney then follow my devlog!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: A lot of my process comes from the amazing book &lt;strong&gt;Hello, my name is awesome&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hello-My-Name-Awesome-Create/dp/1626561869"&gt;Check it out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="projects"></category></entry><entry><title>I managed a fund that gave no money, took no equity and had an exit</title><link href="http://jon.io/i-managed-a-fund-that-gave-no-money-took-no-equity-and-had-an-exit" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-02T22:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T22:12:31-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

This would have been the beginning of the Startup community in Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that most of these "VCs", were cookie-cutters: no Entrepreneurial background, no investing background. To kickstart a revolution, a radical change, you need people that take insane risks and act before anyone else does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need leaders, not followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to start my own "fund", with &lt;strong&gt;zero money&lt;/strong&gt;. I called it &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/zerofund"&gt;"The ZeroFund"&lt;/a&gt; and I was giving zero money for zero equity. Yes, zero for zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was giving something more important than anyone else. &lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process to be part of ZeroFund was the following:
1. You had to register your company (for free) on the website
2. You were sent a website template (one-pager) and you had to fill it up with images/videos/photos
3. You had to "rally" to bring visitors to your website and they could pledge "virtual money". If you managed to raise more than the threshold, you were going to the &lt;strong&gt;Stage&lt;/strong&gt;.
4. The Stage was a live event, were you had to present your company live to all your supporters. Then you had to raise $700 from them, something that would give you access to a co-working space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This super fast process forced you to launch, look for users and get your first "paying" customers all while supporting co-working spaces and making your product known. What else you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund went viral. Google and Microsoft donated servers. Hundreds of people started following the companies. A-List mentors joined to help the Startups (CTO of AOL, right-hand man of Bill Gates, Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc). An accelerator in Silicon Valley, flew the companies to a pitch-deck retreat in Italy. And one Startup got funding - and they made it to Series B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund was all about zero sum: We all win when we all win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never gave money but we gave access to a huge network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never took a percentage but we got to meet some epic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I remembered about this after 9 years?
One of these companies got &lt;a href="https://www-benzinga-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25331804"&gt;acquired for $75M yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. Insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund during the years took different forms and occasionally I get an email about restarting it. Maybe now with crypto it could be even easier. Or maybe there is no need because there are so many VCs out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe now it is a bigger need than ever.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FsOu7aO1A"&gt;This is a video (in Greek) that covers ZeroFund on the Stage day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="projects"></category><category term="popular"></category></entry><entry><title>Startup Office hours</title><link href="http://jon.io/startup-office-hours" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-21T13:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2025-04-17T22:12:31-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I get around 100 emails from Entrepreneurs asking for my feedback/help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I love it, it goes against my two rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do undistracted deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact as many people as I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to streamline the process and start "The Startup Office Hours".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reviews in the open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week, I'll pick one Startup that has &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/ARhTF4DydhqGizuK6"&gt;submitted an entry&lt;/a&gt; and I'll do a video review of their pitch deck and/or website. For free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll have a chat with the team and sometimes I'll bring some subject matters experts, angels and VCs to provide some feedback.
That way, I can impact as many people as I can (instead of repeating the same stuff to every Startup) and for the founders, well, 
my network consists mostly of Angel Investors, VCs and Entrepreneurs that can help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/youtube/ai-startup.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and check the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, I am planning to post highlights on my Instagram account, so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;follow me there too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It didn't have thousands of attendees (because there is a thing called &lt;a href="how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;) but it had &lt;a href="how-nfts-will-change-events-and-why-mark-cuban-is-a-genius"&gt;NFTs as tickets&lt;/a&gt;, tons of sponsors and happened in the best place you can be for the summer - Greece. If you don't believe me ask &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2021/07/04/jeff-bezos-vacation-greece/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/06/28/justin-bieber-and-his-wife-hailey-getaway-to-greece-mykonos/"&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/metaverse_selfie.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the story how (and why) this conference started right &lt;a href="https://jon.io/organizing-a-crypto-conference-in-europe-in-less-than-a-month"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this as a guide on how to do your own conference or a huge meetup. And maybe bug &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee"&gt;Gary&lt;/a&gt; to use this brand new &lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;NFT-as-tickets&lt;/a&gt; technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free also to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTU5MDE1MTM4NDYwNjk2?story_media_id=2597301977270937775_35696786"&gt;check some highlights&lt;/a&gt; on my Instagram. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Took me 1 month to organize it and execute it (while I was vacationing in Greece)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same effect as in weddings. If you have one year, it will take you one year of planning. If you have 1 week, it will take you one week of planning. Not relevant but my wedding took me 1 week from planning to execution. Some people call this (the effect, not my wedding) the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"&gt;Parkinson's Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you either need to cut corners &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; have an epic team helping you out. I am blessed that I had an amazing community helping out, making intros to sponsors, even helping with coordination and finding us space. I love you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/people.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Don't over-thinking it and don't over-engineer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use NFTs as tickets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built my own NFT ticketing system and used it, front-running Gary here (sorry Gary).
If you want to learn more about the technology and how to create your own NFT tickets (it is trivial and free!), check this post (&lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;create your own NFT tickets for free in less than 1 minute&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For "V as in MetaVerse" I wanted people to experience "The Metaverse" and it was important for me to have everyone buy NFTs and use a cryptowallet. If we used "normal" tickets it would be lame (Bitcoin 2021 in Miami - I am looking at you). So I did the thing I know really well: destroying my vacations by writing smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from the conference (we had a professional team from LA flying to Athens to document everything - thank you &lt;a href="http://www.northandtouth.com/"&gt;N&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;) are going to be available to people that attended the event and own the NFT. How awesome is that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/clicknft.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Practice what you preach. A crypto conference without using crypto is hilariously lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More than 3200 subscribers in 2 weeks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to build a community? Be yourself and have fun. 
I was posting content &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;non-stop&lt;/a&gt; and I was even posting videos while I was on vacations about how the conference was progressing. Of course we had tons of media sponsors and TV/Radio channels that kept pushing on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/haha.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Be helpful, add value and keep pushing. Don't bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 strict restrictions (everyone must be tested or provide tests)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most challenging part. Checking tests, wearing masks and not being able to have more than 50 people in one space. We could have done the conference in an open space but screen glaring and no WiFi was a no-go. Other than that, once you were inside the space (and your &lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;NFT ticket was scanned and verified&lt;/a&gt;), you were safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/working.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Minimize red-tape and restrictions and if necessary, add them in the beginning of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do more of fun stuff - less of boring stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podiums and slides are terrible. Please stop doing this. We copied the format from my podcast &lt;a href="https://www.wearesiliconbeach.com/"&gt;Silicon Beach&lt;/a&gt; and all the presentations were fireside chats (or as I like to call them "firechats"). &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt; loved them and most of the audience stayed for 6 hours listening to the speakers. On a Saturday. In Greece. During the summer. Yes, it was &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to talk with world class speakers is more interesting, engaging and the audience enjoys it way more. Do more of fun stuff, less of boring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/risa.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Run &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; favorite conference. Feel free to do stuff differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I got epic speakers flying in from the biggest companies on the planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People flew from LA, NY, Monaco, London just to participate in my conference. I am forever grateful to them because this was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/eva.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We gave 2500 euros (~$3000) to participants of the hackathon (yes, we even had a hackathon)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the teams never wrote a smart contract before. But they did their first transaction on the blockchain and figured out how authentication works, how off chain solutions might be faster but have issues, what are these "gas fees" etc. Some teams came by train (6 hours) from Thessaloniki and kicked ass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.freaking.loved.it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/maria.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't overthink it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motto &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;built to fail&lt;/a&gt; has never failed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/palikari.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start small&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't the first time I was organizing an event. I have organized hundreds of events in San Francisco, Europe even in Japan and I was even the organizer of a Google User Technology Group (GTUG) so I had a good idea of how to run an event. Of course going from organizing small meetups to organizing a conference under &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; own brand was a huge leap of faith but you'll never know unless you try :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/mitsos.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Was it easy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no. Not easy AT ALL. I was crazy stressed and during the conference I skipped eating because I was the host of the firechats. But we had so many speakers and not a lot of time and I had to squeeze everyone in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was very gratifying. Most people from the conference went for food afterwards and I had the clarify of fasting &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; being around friends and intelligent people in my favorite place in the world. Awesome feeling.
But the 29 days before that were not fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that didn't work out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had 14 more sponsors that wanted to participate (and they have already signed up for next years' conference!) but I didn't have time to on-board them, collect payments and get their images and websites. I know it sounds easy but I had tons of other things that HAD to happen and I couldn't outsource this. So, one thing I should do is make the process of onboarding automated or at least easier to be done by someone else than me. Definitely a "fail" moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swag. Our swag provider didn't deliver on time. So we had no swag for the conference. Buuuuuut I am going to send swag to everyone that got a ticket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration. It should have been a 3-day conference. 7 hours firechats are brutal. In my defence, I never thought we'll have all these amazing speakers flying to the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food. Damn you COVID! We were not allowed to bring food to the conference so in my "built-to-fail" fashion, I started going to "private lunches" with each team separately. Money was not an issue (thank you again sponsors!) but having to eat 5 times in &lt;em&gt;Day One&lt;/em&gt; and 0 in &lt;em&gt;Day Two&lt;/em&gt; was not balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to formalize this by doing a yearly &lt;em&gt;"Jon V"&lt;/em&gt; conference where I meet my favorite, super smart Entrepreneurs and do a deep dive into technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing how the US is a bit "ahead" in terms of technology and blockchain adoption, I decided to run a &lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; conference and talk about NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs and Startups from inception, to development to productization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about the agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan was simple: Get a huge airbnb, invite some people that want to learn and let's have a hackathon. But I think we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; will take place sometime in the beginning of July in Greece. Maybe Athens? Maybe Kalamata? Maybe somewhere else? It all depends on the location I can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tickets for the event will be &lt;strong&gt;NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;. A limited edition of NFTs will be given for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to volunteers, speakers and people that don't have the financial means to attend. The rest of the tickets/NFTs will be available at various prices ($10-$50). The reason there is a price, is because I want to weed out people that are not committed in coming and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will be three days. Day one, is presentations and workshops about blockchain development, NFTs, branding, fund raising, Startups and anything else we can fit in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day two, is the hackathon and some networking events. You have 24 hours to build a kick ass blockchain project based on a theme to be announced. The first three teams will get a price from our sponsors.
 
Day three, in the morning, we select the winners and that's a wrap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of course will be available online a couple of weeks after the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is that it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha, of course not! There is a surprise in all this. A &lt;strong&gt;hidden&lt;/strong&gt; project that hopefully will be approved by the Greek government as it requires their permission and takes 5 to 10 years to complete. Let's just say for now, that the space where the event with take place, will be a "Metaverse blackhole". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sounds awesome. How can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking for speakers, people to help, sponsors, media sponsors and in general cool people :) If you are one of them or you can suggest someone, join the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/XvCttdjTAM"&gt;Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;. There is a room to coordinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super excited and super stressed but it is going to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If you bought &lt;a href="my-birthday-cake-as-an-nft"&gt;one of my NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, talk to me on Discord because you get a free ticket :D&lt;/p&gt;

They have this epic NFT, pixelated and animated by me, stored in the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and on IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First edition" src="/images/jonscake.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/piece-of-cake_v2s1Oc8vg1/"&gt;second edition&lt;/a&gt; costs &lt;strong&gt;Ξ 0.1&lt;/strong&gt; (UPDATE: it is sold out!), there are only 40 copies and has &lt;strong&gt;unlockable content&lt;/strong&gt;. The content is a numbered acrylic art block that contains the NFT and I will ship it wherever you live. For free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't understand, this NFT comes also with a physical product, send to your place for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unlockable content" src="/images/gift.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This NFT release pushed me to work more on our brand new infrastructure at &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some more geeky details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Piece of cake" is running on the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and IPFS. It is 100% decentralized running on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you buy the NFT, it is immediately available AT NO COST at OpenSea. You can trade it there and make some sweet ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limited Edition NFT has unlockable content that is uses your wallet signature to unlock it and off-the-chain authentication. I am planning to open source this part because I haven't found anywhere how to do this at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is built on Python/Flask, TailwindCSS and Solidity 0.8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops is still a hybrid. Some of our creators are not on the website, others are but we linked them on OpenSea or Rarible and some of them are 100% on the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops will become a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) by the end of 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops DApp can be integrated with other websites &lt;strong&gt;with just one line of code&lt;/strong&gt;, helping artists sell their NFTs directly from their websites. How epic is that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in beta testing, sending me an email and we'll get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More technical details coming at a later post, so sign up to stay in the loop or drop by my &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/gEnk5f4web"&gt;Discord channel&lt;/a&gt;. Oh and don't forget to &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/pieceofcake_limited/"&gt;buy the NFT&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

It was kind of a cheap shot as “huge secret project” are my trigger words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked me if I can join him on a Zoom at 6am. I told him that I am not going to wake up that early even if the President of Greece was on that Zoom call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the Prime Minister and his team of scientists were on the call and I was there, 7am in Los Angeles, half awake, wearing my “A.I pays my bills” t-shirt. The “huge secret project” was not clickbait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to build something that has never been built before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know Greece, I assume it is because you hate good food, sunshine, breathtaking beaches, history, and you haven’t watched “My Big Greek Fat Wedding”. And this comes from someone that is 100% impartial on this (being Greek doesn’t mean I cannot be impartial, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo by Jonathan Gallegos on Unsplash" src="/images/greece-ml.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece has a population of 11 million and during non-COVID19 summers, the country hosts more than &lt;strong&gt;33 million tourists&lt;/strong&gt;. This is &lt;strong&gt;more than 3 times the population of the entire country&lt;/strong&gt;. They all come to Greece and spend most of their time on the (tiny) Greek Islands. Oh, and most of them come &lt;strong&gt;during the three (summer) months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism also supports nearly a quarter of the country’s jobs and represents 20% of the nation’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of COVID19, this is a double-edged sword for the country. On one hand, keeping its borders closed to tourists equals &lt;strong&gt;financial suicide&lt;/strong&gt; for Greece — a country that had just started to recover from a previous financial hardship. On the other hand, blindly accepting &lt;strong&gt;100K to 300K tourists PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt;, translates to “Death by COVID19”, by putting the locals at risk of infection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no country that has the capacity to conduct these many tests or this kind of infrastructure or solution to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Meet EVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is a country-wide AI screening and testing program , thought to be the first of its kind in the world, which has been online since July 1st 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EVA" src="/images/eva.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are one of the lucky ones that can work remotely. What better place to work from than the seaside, munching on tasty Mediterranean food. Again, 100% impartial on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your arrival in Greece, you must fill out an online “passenger locator form” (we call it PLF) providing basic information including which country they are coming from, gender, age, and other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting your information to the GDPR-compliant system (Europe is extremely careful regarding how personal data is stored and handled), a subset of anonymized data arrives to EVA. EVA takes into account how many other people will arrive at the same entry point, availability of tests, and your personal risk profile and responds with a “TEST” or “NO TEST”. All in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “test/no-test” information is sent back to you via email and encoded as a QR CODE that will be scanned upon your arrival in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immigration officer will know at the time of scanning whether you should be sent for testing or you are free to continue your vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sent for testing, your (anonymized) lab results will be fed back to EVA to improve the model and its accuracy — closing the self-learning loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By digitizing the details of a visitor’s trip, Greece can make informed decisions on who should be tested, how tests should be allocated, or whether any borders need to be closed due to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How good EVA is?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion (using only public data) is that EVA is working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04014-z"&gt;The paper that details EVA made it into Nature!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Greece has less than 20 new external infections from 100k visitors per day. The total infections are on average 150 to 200 mostly to internal spread of the virus which is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know any other country that managed to stay open for as long as Greece while having thousands of tourists per day and open bars and restaurants. Of course if Greece wants to keep infections low, will have to impose stricter controls to manage “internal infections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA might seem like a “Deus Ex Machina” but as Greeks say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot expect everything from the Gods — you also have to put some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TeamEVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is the brain child of three very smart people. And me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamsa-bastani-4a346955/"&gt;Hamsa Bastani&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of operations, information and decisions from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimon-drakopoulos-a5663341/"&gt;Kimon Drakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professors of data science and operations at the Marshall School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-gupta-usc/"&gt;Vishal Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professors of data science and operations at the Marshall School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/my-story"&gt;And me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole team is committed in open-sourcing the important parts of EVA and of course a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04014-z"&gt;full publication&lt;/a&gt; will be coming up in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

That was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was 2015 and my Startup had just &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAJJC"&gt;got acquired&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://splunk.com"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-billion dollar Company in the Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Athens/Greece at that point and for the first time, I didn’t have to think 24/7 about customers, bugs and scaling the company. That was someone’s else problem now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that free mental cycles, I decided to focus my energy to something new (at least for me): a book. Or as I’ve been saying since then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BOOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched &lt;a href="https://whatidowithmyhands.com/"&gt;What I do With My Hands&lt;/a&gt; to my friend, &lt;a href="http://www.asiomou.com/"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/a&gt; and she loved the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I &lt;strong&gt;loved&lt;/strong&gt; the idea - she just played along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These 10 little Celebrities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met at my Airbnb in Athens (oh yes, I was staying in Airbnb all over the world for the last three years - hashtag StartupLife) and we came up with these cool(?) things that you can do with your hands. Why? Seriously, I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It was on my todo list for a long time" src="/images/handtrello.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the book spent &lt;strong&gt;five years&lt;/strong&gt; in my Trello todo list, taunting at me, laughing at me and promising eternal glory and recognition. The main reason was me, over-engineering the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to find the perfect layout, website, page, intro everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we all know, being a perfectionist is how you get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ship the fricking book!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a shifting year for me. I reevaluated so many things in my life but more importantly I decided that taking yourself seriously is the worst thing it can happen to your personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go back to basics and start creating more. And then some more. And then add on that. And the first step was releasing that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikve"&gt;Vivi&lt;/a&gt;, made sure that it renders correctly on even the oldest of Amazon Kindle and then fought with the Amazon’s layout creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a free template for the website, got the domain, hosted the website on Github Pages and here you go. Available on Amazon and (in the next couple of weeks) available as a coffee table book. You’ll be able to read it soon in all the hipster coffee places in San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t intend to make money from the book - I keep running “free book” promotions on Amazon but I can do only five days every 90 days. If you want to read it and don’t want to spend $2 on Amazon, send me an email and I’ll send you a PDF version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that whenever I do “soul projects” expecting returns or outside validation I hate the process and I end up getting bored. I know, it is kind of obvious but I keep forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="projects"></category></entry></feed>
