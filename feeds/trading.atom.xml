&lt;p&gt;Before building any algotrading systems, you need to know how to trade manually. What that actually means is that you need to lose money on your own before blaming the machine. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about Foreign Exchange or Forex as the cool guys call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why do we choose Forex for algotrading? Why don't we become millionaires trading like everybody else? Why not just buy Tesla, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter and hope for the best (PS: please read the legal outro at the end of this blog post before buying any stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy answer. You cannot win (or lose) money fast enough by buying stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex has a nice (or terrible, depending on which side of the coin you are) thing called &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage can be 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:1000 depending on how suicidal you are or how sketchy your broker is (don't worry, we'll talk about brokers in the next post). Let's see an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to place a trade of $1k. The logical thing is that in order to buy something that costs $1k, you need to have in your account $1k, right? Nope. You can always get a loan. Oooooooor: Enter leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a 1:100 leverage, we can place a trade and "control" $1k with just $10. For those that failed at math (don't be ashamed, I am one of you), $10 x 100 (leverage) = $1,000.
That means you can trade big and win big! Actually 100 times more &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;! The catch is that you can actually go 100 times more &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;. Let's have another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got my bonus ($1k) and I want to play on Forex.
Without any leverage, I can buy 1,000 Forex units that cost $1 (by the way, there are no Forex units but we'll talk about this later). 
How many units can I buy with 1:50 leverage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answer if 100,000, you did something wrong. The answer is 50,000 ($1,000 x 50 leverage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. One of the reasons that we are doing Forex, is because you can lose/win big. We'll get back to leverage when we start placing trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three more exciting reasons actually that are even more awesome (dare to say awesomer?).
1. Forex (almost) never sleeps. The markets are open ALL DAY, six days per week. To be more exact, there is not one market but four and they are overlapping providing the "all day" effect.
2. Forex is very volatile and there are tons of money moving around (more than 5 trillion &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;). Crazy right? 
3. No fees on trades. You don't pay $10 per trade like you are doing with stocks. Here you pay &lt;em&gt;the spread&lt;/em&gt; which is just a fraction of a cent (again, we'll talk about this in another post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these reasons (leverage, all-day, volatility, fees) make Forex the most exciting platform to build and deploy your algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, Forex brokers. How not to be scammed before even writing a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal outro. This is an engineering tutorial on how to build an algotrading platform for experimentation and FUN. Any suggestions here are not financial advices. 
If you lose any (or all) you money because you followed any trading advices or deployed this system in production, you cannot blame this random blog (and/or me). Enjoy at your own risk. &lt;/p&gt;

Every week, I get at least 10 DMs on twitter asking on how to experiment with algotrading, Forex and portfolio analysis and I've decided that it's time to do something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am planning to cover the basics of how to build your own trading platform, write your own strategies and go on vacations while electrons are making you money. Or zeroing your account. Either way, it is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the examples are going to be in Python even though there might be parts in Erlang and I'll try to keep it as easy as it can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about what the final product will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a system where you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate your strategy (this is called backtesting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute your strategy without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alert you via sms/email for trades and errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be scalable and trivial to deploy new updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to run even from your home (from a raspberrypi for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume this is going to be a total of 20 chapters, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a system similar to the one that I am running the last year and includes a UI, sms alerts, backtesting pipeline, continuous delivery and all the cool stuff that us geeks love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code will be on github and if everything goes well, I'll wrap it up in a book for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have like three chapters almost done, so if you want early access just ping me at - &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;jonromero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="algotrading"></category></entry></feed>
