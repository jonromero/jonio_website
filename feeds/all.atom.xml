&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/category/newsletters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are all of them. 📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could &lt;strong&gt;share it&lt;/strong&gt;🔗!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt; things I learned last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ A Google engineer was convinced that an A.I. became sentient. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/1535716256585859073?t=D_aprEnsHL0dAWgv4XqDuw&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;And he got suspended for it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have a controversial opinion. I believe that we shouldn't discuss whether the A.I. was sentient but how many of us are not some kind of an A.I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's do a small &lt;strong&gt;experiment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/day-minus-one"&gt;In this link, you can find a small story&lt;/a&gt;. This story is a part of an interactive book I've been writing. 📖&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read it, comment below if you have figured out what that story meant, and I'll tell you next week in my newsletter if you are an A.I. or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Jack decided to work on &lt;strong&gt;"web5"&lt;/strong&gt; (huge eye-roll), where he will try to &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/102605/jack-dorsey-tbd-web5-bitcoin"&gt;make Bitcoin a platform as epic as Ethereum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why can he not just use &lt;strong&gt;Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt;? No idea. Bitcoin maximalists are idiots (as all maximalists).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethereum was created &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt; the (super toxic) community of Bitcoin rejected the idea of smart contracts. What happened next was a huge ecosystem (NFTs, DeFi, etc.) was built on Ethereum, and thousands of developers started building cool stuff and a brand new economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bitcoin went from storage of value and digital gold (that goes up and down 40%) to transaction layer (that is super slow and expensive) to consuming the power of a small country to send $5 to someone. Even the majority of hedge funds convert Bitcoin to Wrapped Bitcoin in order to use the Ethereum blockchain and decentralize finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, should you be preparing for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are delusional and want to spend time on something that will probably die in a couple of years, sure, go for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Let's talk about &lt;strong&gt;MVPs&lt;/strong&gt;. (In a Startup context, not in Basketball 😅)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A Minimum Viable Product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following image demonstrates what an MVP is and what is not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/3gt7aQhfTNKsolNvl4EBJjhoQCrRPWjUpG4aaanl16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to build a car, start building something with the same core features (has motion, wheels, carries people, etc.) and iteratively improve it instead of just starting making a part of your end-goal product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that it's perfectly fine to &lt;strong&gt;get rid&lt;/strong&gt; entirely of your MVP after you've validated your idea and start building your product from scratch later in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an excellent video from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;YCombinator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/6f-how-to-plan-an-mvp"&gt;How to Plan an MVP.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;Lacoste&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, the clothing company 🐊) is entering the &lt;strong&gt;web3 space&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;a href="https://undw3.lacoste.com/"&gt;an NFT project and a DAO.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a member of their DAO, you "will be part of the creative process of the Lacoste Underwater products and partnerships", as they say on their Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that every single company has started entering the Web3 space, and some of them are really pushing the envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least the ones that are not running full-fledged scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Media often talk about how &lt;strong&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/strong&gt; (the popular T.V. show) have "predicted the future" multiple times. But in this newsletter, we are &lt;strong&gt;Family Guy&lt;/strong&gt; fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/QY6OgfJNJ7lXIPuitLNlFSjwrRhRLfJkRSBBluI416325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Season 14, Episode 11: &lt;em&gt;The Peanut Butter Kid&lt;/em&gt;, the Griffin family was struggling financially, so Peter, out of nowhere, came up with "&lt;strong&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt;"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This episode was originally aired on &lt;strong&gt;January 10, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;, when the price of bitcoin was around &lt;strong&gt;$450&lt;/strong&gt;. If the family had listened to him, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ovp6py/how_peter_griffin_family_guy_could_have_become_a/"&gt;they could have become Crypto Millionaires.&lt;/a&gt; 💰💰💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could &lt;strong&gt;share it&lt;/strong&gt;🔗!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt; things I learned last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ What does &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"It is always sunny in Philadelphia"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has in common with &lt;strong&gt;Web3&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/EjKyiKOERUleyEPZ8DclvaOsVMfjqYsdpB6mdTIJ16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob McElhenney (one of the creators and actors of "It's always sunny") is starting a new Web3 Entertainment company (literally 7 minutes from my house) that focuses on storytelling. The idea is that decentralized writers will create IP and share profits from future revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To participate, you cannot just buy the NFT, but you have to be selected by sending who is your favorite character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is &lt;a href="https://adimverse.com/"&gt;pretty epic&lt;/a&gt;, and you should definitely check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Are you ready for the &lt;strong&gt;strangest&lt;/strong&gt; business move of the week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/salesforce-takes-crypto-plunge-with-new-nft-cloud/"&gt;Salesforce is starting its own NFT Platform.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers will be able to host, buy and sell NFTs using Salesforce, and I just have to ask, "why?" Any idea? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best answers get ✌️&lt;strong&gt;299 $Victory coins&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Crypto keeps crashing 📉 but tons of new &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; players are entering the market. Maybe that's a signal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-07/citadel-securities-virtu-form-crypto-plan-with-fidelity-schwab"&gt;new crypto trading platform&lt;/a&gt; is being built by Citadel, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab - the biggest financial companies in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe these guys know something that the rest of us don't know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Just a quick reminder to all founders out there! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.
(&lt;em&gt;Reid Hoffman&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Don't let perfectionism ruins your progress. As soon as you have built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), launch it and get valuable feedback from your customers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You always can improve it in future iterations 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Did you know that there are currently more than &lt;strong&gt;10,000 cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt;, divided into over &lt;strong&gt;150 different categories&lt;/strong&gt;? It's a chaotic space! 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most known crypto-sectors are; Metaverse, DeFi, Algorithmic Stablecoin, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Exchange, NFTs and Collectibles, DAO, Gaming, Move to Earn, Ethereum Ecosystem, Polygon Ecosystem, Solana Ecosystem, Yield Farming, and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/cryptocurrency-category/"&gt;Coinmarketcap&lt;/a&gt; has created an index for each cryptocurrency category. 📈 If you are unfamiliar with the term, a cryptocurrency index helps investors get exposure in specific sectors using a well-diversified pre-build crypto portfolio. These indices eliminate the risk and the knowledge required to invest in these markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹Did you know that there are multiple cryptocurrency indices to invest in❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹Have you ever used one of them❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹If yes, what's your favorite platform❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📥 Hit reply and let me know 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt; things I learned last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I don't know if you know, but I wrote a book 📘 &lt;strong&gt;about my hands&lt;/strong&gt; 👐 and I am giving it away for free!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is a whole story behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I wanted to write a book. And to learn how to self-publish and promote a book, I "wrote" a book called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"What I do with my hands"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href="https://jon.io/why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands"&gt;read the full story here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the experience, but I mostly loved how everyone loved the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for a whole week, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/What-I-do-my-hands-ebook/dp/B0832CT9FT"&gt;download it for free from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, but please write your &lt;strong&gt;honest opinion as a review&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Almost a year ago, the head of Product of OpenSea was fired as the community figured out that he was buying NFTs &lt;strong&gt;right before putting them on the main page&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing is that he was &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme"&gt;charged In the First-Ever Digital Asset Insider Trading Scheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means two things:
1. NFTs are starting to have tighter regulations around them
2. There are real-world (not only in the metaverse) consequences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 I wonder if this will create a precedent for all these scams that take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Remote work&lt;/strong&gt; has grown into a &lt;strong&gt;controversial&lt;/strong&gt; topic, specifically in the tech industry. As we gradually get back to normal after Covid19 restrictions, some companies decide to go permanently to remote work, while others try to enforce a return to office policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://jon.io/the-wealth-transfer-has-started-but-it-is-not-what-you-think"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; ago, I wrote how &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-apple-machine-learning-director-resigned-over-its-office-return-policy-115040691.html"&gt;Apple lost its Director of Machine Learning because they wanted everyone back in the office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla executives, &lt;strong&gt;demanding&lt;/strong&gt; employees return to the office. Actually, he wrote that &lt;em&gt;"Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt;) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/WYBZ8qRW8v9okHRFTABfRmh0CP6jpWlh8AUhCRPx16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamNissim/status/1531810291222192130"&gt;follow-up email&lt;/a&gt;, trying to defend his decision, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more senior you are, the more visible your presence must be. That is why I lived in the factory so much - so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/4oE10Wmi6QvWfYQJ6kXDP2r6Q5fa3MJVPnydKE0S16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What &lt;strong&gt;do you think&lt;/strong&gt; about this? Is remote work a productivity or innovation killer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📥 Hit reply and let me know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Here is a really cool infographic explaining how Startups Funding works and the concept of Stock Dilution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you a brief idea, most of the time, the stages of a Startup 🚀 are going as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idea stage [You]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Co-founder stage [You + Co-founder(s)]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pre-seed [Family and Friends, Angel Investors]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seed Round [Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Series A, B, C, ... [Venture Capitalists, Investment Bankers]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPO (Initial Public Offering) [Anyone]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dilution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; happens when a company issues additional stock, which comes with growth. When successful companies grow, it is common for them to raise capital in multiple funding rounds. Each funding round involves issuing more shares, which consequently results in dilution. Keep in mind that a lower percentage of ownership of a more valuable company will be worth more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/LrjV8b62M4nQCpscqaVYse66p3btzTuDMsaRAHDf16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💾 If you are a founder, you should download and study this image!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Last but not least - if you are in San Francisco, don't forget to try out the &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2022/6/1/23150217/san-francisco-nft-restaurant-club-sho"&gt;NFT Restaurant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the food is real - you don't just "taste it" in the metaverse 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/category/newsletters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could share it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the crazy things I learned last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Let's start with something awesome, as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 3-4 of you that don't know, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/"&gt;Y Combinator (YC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an American technology startup accelerator launched in March 2005. It has been used to launch more than 3,000 companies, including some of the most iconic startups in the world like &lt;em&gt;Stripe, Airbnb, Cruise, PagerDuty, DoorDash, Coinbase, Instacart, and Dropbox, Twitch, and Reddit&lt;/em&gt;. The combined valuation of the top YC companies was more than &lt;strong&gt;$300 billion&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 by January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company's accelerator program started in Boston, and Mountain View expanded to San Francisco in 2019 and has been &lt;strong&gt;entirely online&lt;/strong&gt; since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an aspiring founder and want to learn and get inspired by the best, you should enroll in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.startupschool.org/"&gt;Aspiring Founder Track course.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course provides a straightforward recipe to get you from &lt;strong&gt;0 to MVP&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 1: &lt;strong&gt;Should I Start a Startup?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 2: &lt;strong&gt;Generating Startup Ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 3: &lt;strong&gt;Vetting a Startup Idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 4: &lt;strong&gt;Finding a Co-Founder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 5: &lt;strong&gt;Planning an MVP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Module 6: &lt;strong&gt;Future Plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/GV9Fh2uJdAibJZP6U0LWGUZ480Vf13B2h8eUlUYL16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 Don't forget that I have launched a similar email course (&lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;Built to fail&lt;/a&gt;) designed to teach you the exact ideas and proven strategies that top entrepreneurs use to try out their ideas without spending any time and money. If you haven't done ti yet, you should definitely &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Is your company by default &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dead or alive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham - the founder of the &lt;a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/"&gt;most iconic Startup accelerator in the world&lt;/a&gt; 😉 - said something 7 years ago that couldn't be truer today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming your expenses remain constant and your revenue growth is what it has been over the last several months, can you be profitable on the money they have left? Or to put it more dramatically, by default do you live or die?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html"&gt;read the amazing article here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Are you &lt;strong&gt;struggling to raise money?&lt;/strong&gt; 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a simple &lt;strong&gt;equation&lt;/strong&gt; for you that will show you how much money you can raise right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before that, a short story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of &lt;em&gt;WeWork&lt;/em&gt; just &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/101259/wework-founder-raises-70m-for-carbon-credit-crypto-project-a16z-leads-round"&gt;raised $70M for a web3 company.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the same guy that lost around &lt;strong&gt;$1B&lt;/strong&gt; less than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did he do it? &lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;. That's it. He had a big network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can lie to yourself that the product is the most important (which, of course, sometimes it is), but the equation is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terrible product: 0                        &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok product: 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic product: 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No network: $0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ok network: $1M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good network: $5M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Epic network: $10M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You multiply the product with the network, and this is the money you can raise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Ok Product" * "Ok network" = you might raise $3M&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much money do you think you can raise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: The equation is similar to what &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/multiply"&gt;Derek posted some time ago.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Netflix is trying to get into the NFT space, and I love what they are doing with their &lt;strong&gt;"Love, Death + Robots"&lt;/strong&gt; show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a &lt;a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/love-death-robots-nft/"&gt;Scavenger Hunt&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QR codes are sprinkled in some episodes; you scan them 🤳 and unlock some NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty similar to what I do on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;my YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ It's been a long time since I've given out some Victory coins, so here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📢 &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/hothothot"&gt;The first 10 of you can claim 99 $Victory coins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the marketplace will be up in June, and you'll be able to use them to get swag, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/advisory"&gt;book meetings with me&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever else comes to my mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href="http://victory.jon.io/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you have no idea what a ✌️ &lt;strong&gt;$Victory&lt;/strong&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/category/newsletters"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the &lt;strong&gt;highlights&lt;/strong&gt; of the past week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ If you are looking for a new job, a new role, or just a &lt;strong&gt;raise&lt;/strong&gt;, here is a trick to &lt;strong&gt;get 15% more money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, there is one &lt;strong&gt;simple&lt;/strong&gt; trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most people never negotiate their salary. Never.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is insane. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of them were afraid that they might lose their position because they asked for more money. I can tell you right now that a company that won't hire you because you asked for more money &lt;strong&gt;during&lt;/strong&gt; negotiations is a company that you should avoid at all costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious exceptions - like being delusional and asking an insane amount. But let's talk about my trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each company has a specific budget for a position. It doesn't matter if you are god-on-earth; you won't get a higher salary than the allocated budget. That also means that you can "push" your way to the upper bracket of the position because that budget is available for taking. 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to find the upper bracket is through research. Look what similar (competitor) companies pay or try to find anyone you know at that company and ask them. Sometimes they might even know the hiring manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My approach is &lt;strong&gt;just to ask&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;what is the budget for this position?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single time, you'll get a number, and you can safely &lt;strong&gt;add 5%-15%&lt;/strong&gt; to that. No hiring manager quotes the upper limit, but they often mention the lower. And only an inexperienced HR manager will ask, &lt;em&gt;"how much money do you want?"&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you negotiated your salary? What was your experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📥 Hit the reply button and let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Did you know that &lt;strong&gt;Madonna released an NFT project?&lt;/strong&gt; If not, oh, you are in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check &lt;a href="https://motherofcreation.xyz/"&gt;Mother of Creation&lt;/a&gt; - it is NSFW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ People keep asking me: &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"How is really the glorious life of an Entrepreneur?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuaF1cwNJ-0"&gt;This video is for all of you!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/9CLz6fQ3j3eygHWlwqcwk7yeT8MYm7X183crVGPr16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonVlachogiannisJonVasinVictory"&gt;subscribe to the channel&lt;/a&gt; because some &lt;strong&gt;crazy&lt;/strong&gt; videos are coming up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ In &lt;a href="https://jon.io/the-wealth-transfer-has-started-but-it-is-not-what-you-think"&gt;my previous email&lt;/a&gt;, I wrote about how Apple lost its Director of Machine Learning because they wanted everyone back in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems now that &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/apple-return-to-work-policy-alphabet-machine-learnin-1848942742/amp"&gt;Apple has reversed its decision&lt;/a&gt;, but it probably is too late now because ML Director Ian Goodfellow will reportedly join Alphabet's DeepMind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote work wins&lt;/strong&gt; 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ In the last few newsletters, I decided to dedicate the last part of the email to providing &lt;strong&gt;helpful information&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;actionable tips&lt;/strong&gt; to entrepreneurs trying to start their journey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_buildd/status/1483297142165098500?t=t32LhFlkB0UCEur3jLdm1g&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;17 tools for building your startup for FREE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;If you plan never to work again, the following paragraphs are vital.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven't watched the news, the stock market is crashing, the crypto market is crashing, tech companies are firing people left and right, and Startup investments have been frozen. 📉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I call a "wealth transfer event".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I owned a Wealth Management firm, managing millions of high-net-worth Individuals, Entrepreneurs with exits, and Celebrities, and I've seen a couple of patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is those who sold whenever the market was going down, waiting for the market to go up and then entering again. These are the people that lost a tremendous amount of wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second pattern&lt;/strong&gt; is those that never changed their investment habits (invest after you do your research, don't change your investment thesis UNLESS your data has changed). These lost the least amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;only group&lt;/strong&gt; that made insane returns was the one that I was advising, and my thesis (the last 8 years) is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never listen to what billionaires do. They have an infinite amount of cash to put into the game, and you don't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money never stays in one place. If something goes down, money should be flowing somewhere else. Unless...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone is trying to shake the market to make even more money - thus transferring your wealth to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think like you own a multibillion hedge fund: if you don't believe in tech companies in the US, where in the world could you place your money and NOT GET FIRED?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should silly? Welcome to the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/introducing-digital-collectibles-to-showcase-nfts-instagram/"&gt;Instagram has added NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and all I am waiting for is for Meta to release their own crypto wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I tell you that a "fruit" company is working on its own crypto wallet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Four years ago, I wrote an article about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/why-i-love-working-remotely-and-why-your-company-cannot-and-never-will"&gt;why your company sucks and will never let you work remotely.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 definitely helped my case as many companies that went remote are now crawling back to the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/an-apple-machine-learning-director-resigned-over-its-office-return-policy-115040691.html"&gt;Apple just lost its Director of Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; because they wanted everyone back in the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep hearing tons of engineers (especially in Europe) &lt;strong&gt;commanded&lt;/strong&gt; to return to their desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one of those engineers, send me a DM, and I'll send you a list of kick-ass companies that hire remote people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/05/11/crypto-startup-funding-boomed-in-q1-despite-ongoing-market-slide"&gt;Crypto Startup funding is &lt;strong&gt;unfazed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This really blows my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crypto market is down. The stock market is down. Startup funding is down. 📉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are a crypto Startup - confetti! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main driver is that all web2 companies haven't slowed down their investments in the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the new dot-com bubble is just a dot-Ether bubble?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Did you know that you can &lt;strong&gt;host your website for absolutely FREE?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps you have to do when building your startup is to create an appealing website describing what you do and why your product is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many entrepreneurs spend a ridiculous amount of money on marketing agencies to build their brand identity and a (mediocre) website before they even worry about building something useful and their product-market fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt; is a free service from GitHub that allows everyone to host multiple (static) websites and connect them with custom domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is a catch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an engineer, &lt;strong&gt;don't fall for overengineer stuff&lt;/strong&gt;. Just set up a website that does the work and publishes it. You will always have the chance to improve it later in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on things that matter! 🔥&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the crazy things I learned last week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;strong&gt;Bored Apes&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the biggest NFT projects (actually, it is a social club) with tons of Celebrities, insane prices, and plenty of epic events. Bored Apes have even their own coin, &lt;strong&gt;ApeCoin&lt;/strong&gt;, pretty similar to my own ✌️ &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coin&lt;/a&gt; that you can get 49 coins for free by &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/ape"&gt;clicking right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/qpPjiaFIeMjcObe6Q5oq4edn8k3VJnrREG3DzYYC16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company behind it Bored Apes - Yuga Labs - is building a game called Otherside, and you can buy some virtual land for the price of 305 ApeCoin (around $5k). Or at least you could try buying land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the crazy traffic on the Ethereum network, people had to pay a premium of up to $15k (in gas fees) just for the opportunity to buy some land. As a matter of fact, the whole Ethereum blockchain was affected due to the overwhelming response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuga Labs decided to refund people that paid these crazy gas fees (a pretty awesome move, in my opinion), but the question still stands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 "Would you buy into the Yoga Labs universe? Are you planning to get some assets in their new game? Could they become as big as Nintendo?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Did you know that Nintendo was founded in &lt;strong&gt;1889&lt;/strong&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See how their logos changed through their history:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/DGNs5TcNrFIHWIoQ2bgyYSp1CpSpuPRn8rD9C0J716325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo is the definition of a versatile company that evolves with the times while remaining on top. Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"&gt;Wikipedia article&lt;/a&gt; and read how they kicked ass all these years. Maybe there is something you can copy for your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I own a significant amount of &lt;strong&gt;$NTDOY&lt;/strong&gt;, and this is not investment advice 📈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week, I went to play some music, and I decided to shoot a video that doesn't have to do with Startups or Crypto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/ndAn5gFYZ0Y0eM6xMK2dMGfoB1RZK8JqhndOWtNi16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyCyVFbO8Lc"&gt;Check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt; to the channel because some crazy videos are coming up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I know, too much NFT/Crypto news, but the market is uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/04/starbucks-to-launch-nfts-this-year-offering-access-to-unique-experiences-and-benefits/"&gt;Starbucks is building an NFT project&lt;/a&gt; and is creating a social club. Maybe you get a special edition Latte? Maybe a &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Frappucino on Solana"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 😏?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea. All I know is that "working at Starbucks" will become even more hipster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Many readers of this newsletter are &lt;strong&gt;founders&lt;/strong&gt; who are trying to build the next unicorn. 🦄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you build a &lt;strong&gt;bootstrap startup with limited resources&lt;/strong&gt;, you want to take advantage of every opportunity to &lt;strong&gt;promote&lt;/strong&gt; your product/service and get &lt;strong&gt;traction&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when you are starting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ If you've never heard about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Kamikaze Marketing"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, grab a chair and listen to the story of how &lt;strong&gt;Coca-Cola&lt;/strong&gt; destroyed &lt;strong&gt;Pepsi's&lt;/strong&gt; Diet by destroying themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's 1992, and the &lt;strong&gt;"wellness"&lt;/strong&gt; hype is taking over corporate America. It's all about "&lt;strong&gt;clean"&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;"healthy"&lt;/strong&gt;, and Pepsi decided to take over that new market by introducing a new product called "Crystal Pepsi".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal Pepsi was pretty much like a transparent clear Pepsi, with the same calories and same amount of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola planned to release their version called "Tab Clear," whose primary focus was wellness and fitness - even though the beverage had tons of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that Coca-Cola had wasn't to create just new diet soda. They wanted to poison the minds of the consumers with the idea that diet drinks especially drinks marketed as "clear", are actually bad and unhealthy. Tab Clear will go down with Crystal Pepsi as consumers get confused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's what happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tab Clear went out of production in 2 months, and Crystal Pepsi went out in 18 months burning more than $40M just in marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ 📢 I am preparing a &lt;strong&gt;mega video&lt;/strong&gt; where I answer as many questions as possible, and I thought, why not make it more interesting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;strong&gt;I want you&lt;/strong&gt; to help me out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this phone number ☎️ &lt;strong&gt;+1 (323) 540-4263&lt;/strong&gt;‬, there is a voicemail. You can call any time you like and ask ANY question you have about Startups, NFTs, crypto, life, or whatever. You can even pitch your Startup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprise me. I think it is going to be hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick up the phone and give me a call! 🤙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/1fVadptEUNafC7lR6CL4p1JGRRUWUTD3UfbaW0R816325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JonVlachogiannisJonVasinVictory"&gt;Join the Jon V YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A couple of months ago, I posted about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/nft-shoes-and-some-of-you-are-getting-free-books"&gt;Nike acquiring an NFT company&lt;/a&gt; that made digital shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week Nike released their &lt;strong&gt;new NFT shoes&lt;/strong&gt; (2000 of them to be exact) that go for $7k to $10k, and you can use some "vials" to change their skins. One vial got sold for around $450k and another for $133k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Nike made around $2M just from selling skins for the digital shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/exqrbEOZ6CxUmhNylo7F2JMDGcO5ntt60Wb3ZVhI16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that Nike &lt;strong&gt;made 12X of the money 💰 they spent in less than 3 months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a bad investment at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Belgian horses 🐎 and Startups 🚀 have a lot in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgian horses are extremely powerful animals. One horse can pull around 8000 pounds. The intriguing part is that two horses can pull &lt;strong&gt;three times more&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, 24000 pounds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what blows my mind is the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horses that have been training together for some time, can pull 32000 pounds. FOUR TIMES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's exactly what happens with Startups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One dedicated Founder can change a city. A team can change a country. A team with a common cause can change the world. 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Do you have some hands-on experience with &lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Deep Learning)&lt;/strong&gt; and want to get better while making some bucks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you should check &lt;a href="https://numer.ai/"&gt;Numerai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/G5Y9Qka1FZo6pynLkHtcLxB0n7NsKwBrfAhIn9W816325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerai is an AI-run, crowd-sourced hedge fund in San Francisco. This means that thousands of Data Scientists join forces every week to build Machine Learning models based on abstract financial data to predict the stock market and control the Numerai hedge fund. This is called the Numerai Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exciting part is that you can put skin in the game yourself by staking on your models with the NMR cryptocurrency to earn rewards based on performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Numerai formed a DAO to engage the community and join forces to build more exciting projects funded by the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👋 Hello everyone, the last topic was written by me, the Chief of Chaos &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-papaemmanouil/"&gt;Panagiotis Papaemmanouil&lt;/a&gt;!
Connect with me on &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-papaemmanouil/"&gt;Linked In&lt;/a&gt;, where I write about how you can break into Data Science and more cool stuff about Python, AI / Machine Learning / Deep Learning, Product, and entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ You cannot build a FormulaOne car in a village. And here is why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are ready to ride the train and hear someone playing the violin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You smile, and you throw a couple of dollars in their empty violin case - just for making you smile and move on with your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did you know that you heard &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/pearls-before-breakfast-can-one-of-the-nations-great-musicians-cut-through-the-fog-of-a-dc-rush-hour-lets-find-out/2014/09/23/8a6d46da-4331-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html"&gt;Joshua Bell performing&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most famous violinists on earth, that people pay $100 to $500 to attend his concerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story talks about how we don't pay attention to things around us and lead a habitual life, but there is something more for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joshua Bell couldn't charge $100 for playing at the train station even if he had a big neon sign saying "I AM THE BEST IN PLAYING THE VIOLIN".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is about location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I wrote why you should strive to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/be-in-the-future-room"&gt;be in the future rooms&lt;/a&gt; with Mark Cuban. And many people send me emails saying that now, with remote work, you don't have to be in the same physical room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I doubt that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every place has a specific kind of energy fueled by the society around it. It is the history, the knowledge, people's habits, and everything that makes a place special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to compete in Formula One, be where all the drivers are. Be where the teams hang out, where the cars are built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Else you can just &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106611/"&gt;attend the Winter Olympics with the Jamaican Team.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Jack Dorsey (the founder of Twitter) sold his first tweet as NFT for &lt;strong&gt;$2.9M&lt;/strong&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then the buyer put it up for sale for &lt;strong&gt;$48M&lt;/strong&gt;, got some bids around ... &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/04/13/jack-dorseys-first-tweet-nft-went-on-sale-for-48m-it-ended-with-a-top-bid-of-just-280/"&gt;$280&lt;/a&gt;, and today it is &lt;a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/business/twitter-founder-jack-dorsey-s-first-tweet-up-for-grabs-for-14-000-a-red-signal-for-nfts--news-192116"&gt;$14k&lt;/a&gt; to $30k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why that crazy drop in price?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know, Jack likes "bumping" Bitcoin even though every single project for the last 5 years has taken place on Ethereum. Even his &lt;strong&gt;NFT was sold on the Ethereum blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is a Bitcoin maximalist, and I can tell you that &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt; who considers themselves "maxi" in anything is extremely "mini" in their world views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to our story. So, Jack decided to sell his NFT, get his Ether, and convert it to Bitcoin to send it to a non-profit. Slow clap, Jack. Slow clap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ethereum community doesn't really care about all this drama, but collectors care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And someone is stuck with a $3M png file.&lt;/strong&gt; 💸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last Friday, we had a Live where you called in, and I answered as many questions as I could about Startups, Product and Crypto. It was pretty epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/13stY5yO33Y"&gt;Startup or Shut up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/hwyY585NZexLEO9E5vzV3M92SUxX3m42x6QXSfQl16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put it in the background and enjoy the vibes. The next one is next Thursday, and I'll try to have some guests 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ In the modern world, the average person sends dozens of emails 📧 per week and receives a lot more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 But have you ever considered &lt;a href="https://iammagnus.com/2020/11/write-letter-your-future-self.html"&gt;sending an email to yourself in the future&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending emails to your future self is a powerful technique to talk directly to you in the future. Whether you're hoping to achieve specific goals, follow up on bucket list items, or give words of affirmation, your future self will be grateful to receive a letter no matter what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can schedule emails for several months or years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be as detailed as possible. Attach images, voice notes, links, etc. Talk about who you are now and your goals, and write about a tough decision you have to make and your thoughts about it. Also, don't forget to address your future self. Give yourself advice, ask questions, and add things you want to stop, continue, and start doing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Write-a-Letter-to-Your-Future-Self"&gt;Start writing now&lt;/a&gt;, and you soon will realize the progress you are making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot can change in a year or rather still be the same if you let it. 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Are you struggling to organize your day and manage your time? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel overwhelmed about what you have to do? Do you always end up procrastinating, scrolling on social media, and binge-watching online videos?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Eisenhower matrix&lt;/strong&gt; is a tool to help you &lt;strong&gt;manage your time and tasks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a decision matrix that categorizes tasks based on importance and urgency and tells you what you must do with each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DECIDE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELEGATE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DELETE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ I really want to make all &lt;strong&gt;Avengers&lt;/strong&gt;🦸move to Mykonos and spend the rest of their days drinking Ouzo. And I might be able to do it pretty soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to decide the ending of a Hollywood movie? Well, Mila (Kunis, that is) &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshwilson/2022/04/12/mila-kunis-produced-series-will-allow-nft-holders-to-decide-the-plot/?sh=d865bcf7ae30"&gt;is producing a new …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you want to decide the ending of a Hollywood movie? Well, Mila (Kunis, that is) &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshwilson/2022/04/12/mila-kunis-produced-series-will-allow-nft-holders-to-decide-the-plot/?sh=d865bcf7ae30"&gt;is producing a new series&lt;/a&gt; that buying the NFT will allow you to decide the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish &lt;strong&gt;Marvel&lt;/strong&gt; follows up soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Elon Mask decided to buy tons of &lt;strong&gt;Twitter stocks&lt;/strong&gt; to make it more "open" - whatever that means. Then he asked if Twitter should be renamed to Titter, said about including an "edit" button and a couple more (terrible) ideas. 🐦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to join the board - the stock price went up almost 20% - and then &lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elon-musks-u-turn-joining-121342739.html"&gt;he decided not to join the board.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, did you know that he failed again to disclose that he got all this stock before telling anyone (including the &lt;strong&gt;SEC&lt;/strong&gt;), and &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2022-04-12/elon-musk-sued-over-delay-disclosing-twitter-stake"&gt;he got sued&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should you care about this? 🤨&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all idolize some people, and we forget that at the end of the day, all of them are just ... people. They are driven by different motives than us, and they might be in a different financial place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✔️ &lt;strong&gt;Copy the best, reject the rest.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Do you want to raise money and figure out why you have no customers, or your team hates you? Or maybe you have tons of crypto questions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jump in this &lt;strong&gt;Live&lt;/strong&gt; 📺 this Friday called: &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/13stY5yO33Y"&gt;Startup or Shut up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/5OUvMVa52NtpCgDjRcofeeETRyNMusljQtp9npk516325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type your questions in the chat 🙋 or call the number on the screen ☎️ (yes, I will have a US phone if you want to pitch your product or ask about something).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be epic with tons of &lt;strong&gt;surprises&lt;/strong&gt; (yes, and we are giving away tons of $Victory ✌️ coins too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ One of my subscribers shared this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jomaoppa/status/1512446577796915202?s=20&amp;amp;t=r-DmdFAcsFH7-Y7T1_MuHQ"&gt;epic video about Wolf Of Wall Street and crypto&lt;/a&gt; with me. It is so hilariously true. 😄&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, do you know that you get 20 &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/a&gt;✌️ every time you contribute something to my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📨 Come on, send me some stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Meta decided that it is a good idea to charge 47.5% transaction fees on NFTs for its Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;47.5% 💸&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/w3iwPi2EzHYfCZCInmlKS4WQXsXagHztFqZYogUF16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter didn't like it. Reddit didn't like it. Literally, no one liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rumors about the Meta cryptocurrency and the wallet are (possibly) not rumors at all. It seems that Meta will start competing with Coinbase as there is an &lt;strong&gt;increase of 2000% in new "crypto" positions&lt;/strong&gt; of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely not the strangest move from Facebo... oh sorry, I mean Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 Would you work for a company like Meta, and if not, why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ If you are an Entrepreneur, you should NEVER be impressed by companies that raise funds 💰 or hit the news 📰. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Fast, a media darling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine raising $100M, laying off 50% of the company, trying to sell whatever remained, and shutting down all &lt;strong&gt;IN SIX …&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ If you are an Entrepreneur, you should NEVER be impressed by companies that raise funds 💰 or hit the news 📰. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Fast, a media darling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine raising $100M, laying off 50% of the company, trying to sell whatever remained, and shutting down all &lt;strong&gt;IN SIX DAYS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/fast-shuts-doors-after-slow-growth-high-burn-precluded-fundraising-options/"&gt;This is the story of the "Fast" company&lt;/a&gt; - no pun intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't get me wrong. &lt;strong&gt;Startups are high-risk/high-return investments&lt;/strong&gt;, but being in the same category as PayPal, Stripe (which was an investor) and having &lt;strong&gt;similar valuation&lt;/strong&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;making only $600k per year&lt;/strong&gt; is stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do I believe this burned to the ground? Let's see:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast was building a fast-one-click checkout. Seriously. HOW MUCH FASTER CAN A CHECKOUT BE? Google Pay, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay are one click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;500 employees for this product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$10M per month operating expenses. $10M per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$600k revenue PER YEAR - I sold NFTs that made more money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding doesn't mean a thing. It usually means that you have predatory VCs screwing up your vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Do you know why companies will never be innovative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📎 Read below the HILARIOUS and out-of-touch interview of Jerry Seinfeld in the latest Harvard Business Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/mDfharrK1hZJ2aqICcQaFdifCjlSXmAbw83cR0vY16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole conversation goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvard - Hey Jerry, you got tired and stuck writing jokes all these years. Have you thought of bringing McKinsey to help out? (I am not making this up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerry - Who is McKinsey?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvard - A consulting company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerry - Are they funny?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvard - No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jerry - Then I don't need them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO on this planet thought that McKinsey would be beneficial to a show like Seinfeld?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies hire consultants that have &lt;strong&gt;no idea&lt;/strong&gt; what's really going on. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are in the trenches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be an Entrepreneur, and I guarantee you that bigger companies will have to buy you out. Or face extinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read the whole interview here -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2017/01/lifes-work-jerry-seinfeld"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld: Comedian, Innovator, Micromanager.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week, I had a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw"&gt;YouTube live&lt;/a&gt; 📺 where I built LIVE a smart contract for a Decentralized Exchange 🤖. The live went for almost an hour and a half, and I answered questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How I create project - my methodology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which blockchain is the best to deploy a smart contract?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I build my own cryptocurrency?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to deploy my smart contract?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which libraries should I be using so I don't lose all my money?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/1mUVtwr0cb4Lbxe9sK2MHTeufbGrHj58WXRNLmW216325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week, I'll release the second part of the video about the UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't forget to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;subscribe to the channel.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ This Monday was my birthday 🎂. And what a better way to celebrate with some cool giveaways! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/birthday"&gt;499 $Victory coins&lt;/a&gt; ✌️ to the first 100 people that will claim them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;opened up my advisory slots&lt;/strong&gt; for this week with an&lt;strong&gt; 80% discount&lt;/strong&gt;. You can &lt;a href="https://https//jon.io/advisory"&gt;check them out here&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;strong&gt;HAPPYBIRTHDAY&lt;/strong&gt; as a coupon 🎫 to get the discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are &lt;strong&gt;paid advisory slots&lt;/strong&gt; (from $499 down to ~$99 for a week) that I usually offer to people that want more structured feedback. I will always have my advisory slots that you can get with $Victory coins ✌️ (the UI is almost ready!), and of course, you can always send your pitch deck to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/startup-office-hours"&gt;Startup Office Hours.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if you want any feedback about your company, Entrepreneurial journey, or NFT/Crypto project, now is the time to buy as many hours as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📥 Send me an email if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Do you want to control your mind with your body? Here is my Wim Hoff journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been practicing Wim Hoff for some time now, and I fell in love with the breathing exercises and the cold showers. And if you know me, I hate cold 🥶. It is one of the many reasons why I love Los Angeles 🌞.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/pdMmQiFjg77xUKPoXXo86mq1mWUOAu5X5zoCwxAj16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I transitioned to ice-cold baths (yes, that's me, in my backyard, inside a container full of ice), and I found the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡We are trying to control our bodies with our minds. Meditation. Inspiring music. Self-talk. We know that if we tame our minds, the body will follow. Cold showers are the only thing that makes my body control my mind. And it is epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Racing thoughts? Stress? Under the weather? Indecisive? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a cold shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is like a shortcut to tame the monkey in your head. Fast, always there, and unable to doge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could talk about cold showers and their benefits for hours, but my good friend Andrew did a scientific 2-hour podcast about this - on my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/izJIAizm6AyRsEobahNRmHrz9S8GFL7xSv5i4Wxx16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📥 I'd love to hear your experience or why you haven't done this yet. I can give you some tips on starting and "embracing the cold".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like to read more about epic stories and edgy attitudes, 📩 join my newsletter, and you'll also get some ✌️ &lt;strong&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/strong&gt; (https://victory.jon.io/) if you are a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Every three months, I sit down and write down ✍️ my commitments for the next quarter. &lt;strong&gt;No goals. Commitments.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎯 With goals, you can wish about the outcome and maybe create a plan of action, but the reality is that the universe doesn't care about your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, the thing that I consider a &lt;strong&gt;superpower is commitment&lt;/strong&gt;, and I've talked about it many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you commit, it is a holy bond between you and yourself—no external help. If you fail, it was because &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; and only you failed. There is no chance, luck, or however you call it. No one to hold you down or mess up your mojo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side, you get no luck breaks or outside help. Well, you cannot have it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have never tried it before, write down something you really want to achieve and consciously commit to it. Don't go big before you have exercised your "commitment" muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'll go for a run every morning for 30 days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I won't eat sugar for 6 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will write a blog post every week for a year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it, and I guarantee you that you'll be unstoppable 🔥 after committing to a couple of things. If you cannot bring yourself down, no one can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ This week, I have a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw"&gt;YouTube live&lt;/a&gt;, and I am &lt;strong&gt;building LIVE a smart contract for a Decentralized Exchange.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will not be a hardcore engineering video as I plan to include many product development and marketing details, so if you are not an engineer, come, chill and ask your heart out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/1mUVtwr0cb4Lbxe9sK2MHTeufbGrHj58WXRNLmW216325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll go over:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenZeppelin libraries and why you should be using them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sending tokens to a contract, and why it doesn't work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying on the blockchain (Ethereum and Polygon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating an API in the smart contract for our web3 app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw"&gt;Come and say hi!&lt;/a&gt; I'll be giving away some free tokens too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last time I talked about the &lt;a href="https://jon.io/750k-salaries-and-raising-money-with-nfts"&gt;$750k salaries of web3 engineers&lt;/a&gt; and I got a lot of messages that said something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a team in &lt;insert your favorite outsource country&gt; that does smart contracts for $1k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the challenge with smart contracts is that if you are not a senior engineer, you might &lt;strong&gt;end up losing a lot of money for the company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001620/sky-mavis-axie-infinity-ronin-blockchain-validation-defi-hack-nft"&gt;Like $625M.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web3 development is one of the very few jobs where you wouldn't like to outsource due to price. Only for scarcity. Learn how to build on web3 as your job depends on it. Because it probably does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Making money 💸 from a side hustle is ridiculously easy. In case you haven't done it already, sign up for my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;free email course that teaches you the basics of how to build a side gig.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to release my &lt;strong&gt;full course&lt;/strong&gt; 📚 in the next couple of months, and we'll all sit together and show you how to do a business that makes $1k per month. In one month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/landforce/status/1509191770541723649?t=0IRGvUbtJYKqtcs3VYw0wQ&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;here is an example.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you taken my free course in the past❓ Would you subscribe to the new one❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Last week, an astronaut 👨‍🚀 walked for seven hours in space. Alone. In the freaking space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It blows my mind that we built a whole base in outer space, and we have people walking around doing errands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ It's time for you to work for a DAO. At least part-time. Or you won't have any job in the future. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've written &lt;a href="https://jon.io/becoming-a-genius-robots-in-preschools-and-daos-against-hedge-funds"&gt;many times about DAOs&lt;/a&gt;, but now it is time to talk about a DAO that I helped start: &lt;strong&gt;KaramelaDAO&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/exKVg8DFTzeQOpj3Iy75yOwBbAHvV3C905jgbI8016325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://karameladao.com/"&gt;KaramelaDAO's&lt;/a&gt; main purpose is to let people experiment with crazy ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ideas we are playing around with are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buying an island and converting it to a crypto island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a Virtual Influencer from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reaching $1B in revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty crazy ideas if you ask me. 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KaramelaDAO has Citizens, its own currency ($Lollipop) that is connected to its treasury (that's a first!), and a very vibrant community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having participated in many DAOs, if you want to experience the future of work, &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/xXYWhbNvyS"&gt;come and join us on Discord.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We even have a team for onboarding, and they will give you some $Lollipops for free, guide you on how to use your wallets, how to vote, how to propose new stuff, and tons of other cool info that will take you a couple of months to figure out yourself. You can even earn $Lollipops by completing bounties!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you want to become a Citizen, &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/karameladao/karameladao-nft-citizenship-first-builders_XnrLpELhoy/"&gt;you can grab one of our 10 Citizen NFTs&lt;/a&gt; that come with a digiphysical (you get an actual hat!), and 250 $lolls per year for four years (like vesting)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ A couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan"&gt;I posted about taking a monthly storytelling and filmmaking course.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've said many times that storytelling is vital to acquire and engage customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not about the product. It is about the damn story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihJZgEO8BI"&gt;this is the final video&lt;/a&gt; I did for the course. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/UHZ9mKDtSxHKRGiweYDxxdskAgsp1Xd2ybob5zWe16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A month ago, I posted on &lt;a href="https://jon.io/"&gt;my site&lt;/a&gt; how you can make $300k 💰 by switching to web3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the price is now at &lt;a href="https://thedefiant.io/web3-soaring-salaries/"&gt;$750k per year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any bets what's happening 6 months from now? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Jon, you are wrong! Web3 is dead. The Product Lead of Crypto at VISA just left to join a payments company."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an email from one of my readers at &lt;a href="https://jon.io/"&gt;my site&lt;/a&gt; that works for a pretty big company in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, she is right. Partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Daniel left VISA. &lt;a href="https://thefifthskill.com/visas-crypto-product-lead-leaves-for-payments-startup/"&gt;For a Payments Company.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more accurate, he joined &lt;a href="https://www.ansiblelabs.xyz/"&gt;THIS COMPANY&lt;/a&gt;. Click the link and check what the first thing on their homepage is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll save you a click: &lt;strong&gt;web3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He left VISA to join a web3 company.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is your CV?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;$2.6 Billion dollars.&lt;/strong&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/nft-startups-seed-venture-growth-sxsw-yuga/"&gt;the amount of money raised last year from Startups that had "NFT" in the strategy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And trust me on that, 99% of them should have stayed away from NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡 If you are building a Startup, &lt;strong&gt;focus on providing value&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to raise money and work with VCs as your employers, add "NFT support" to your company, and good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2022/03/15/mark-zuckerberg-instagram-nft-marketplace-mint/"&gt;Instagram will add NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, and it is not something that I didn't know as Meta is hiring Web3 engineers like crazy.
This means that a MetaCoin is not far, and a MetaWallet is coming soon. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I've been doing &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;Startup pitch deck reviews&lt;/a&gt; for some time now, and I keep getting more and more pitch decks to the point that even if I post one every day, it will take me a couple of years to go through all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/5vF09Oj8J2azTjfmnBIn6XQJ7GfG1IuQL3p43ssA16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to find a way to make this &lt;strong&gt;scalable&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;more impactful&lt;/strong&gt; as there are a lot of good ideas here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that I am experimenting with some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll open my &lt;strong&gt;advisory slots&lt;/strong&gt; to everyone (currently, I keep 10 slots per month for bigger companies). To book a slot, you need to have ✌️ &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/a&gt;, or if you are a bigger company/organization, grab a paid slot - if available. If you are interested in this, please send me an email, and I'll send you an email with more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch my first version of my &lt;strong&gt;Startup Course&lt;/strong&gt; 📚 that covers how to make a great pitch deck&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a &lt;strong&gt;"Live Pitch Deck Review"&lt;/strong&gt; once per month on Youtube with as many pitch decks as I can cover. It will be fun 😀&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;📩 Let me know what do you think! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ One of the personas I want to create - I talked about alter egos &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; - is someone that has no idea about crypto. And then, I'll start attending crypto events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/15/cryptocurrency-coinbase-fintech-bros"&gt;this guy here and his hilarious story.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Startup events have turned into crypto events, and that's not bad (ok, it is bad and annoying), but at least I get to see how people approach new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever attended a crypto event? What's your take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ There was an NFT project - a game, to be more specific - called Pixelmon. It released some footage of their amazing artwork, and yes - $70M 💰 was raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days passed, and the community wanted to see the game and experience the artwork. And then the memes came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read about the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/people-spent-9k-on-pixelmon-nfts-then-they-saw-the-art/"&gt;story and definitely check the images and the videos.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely hilarious. 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Last week, I talked about how IHOP 🥞 was &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan"&gt;trying to copy my $Victory coins with their PanCoins.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, the heavy metal band 🤘 &lt;a href="https://megadeth.com/news/2022/megacoin-gibson-giveaway/"&gt;Megadeth has released $MegaCoins.&lt;/a&gt; You can get some of them if you are part of their community, and you can spend them on swag/tickets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly as my✌️ &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/megajon"&gt;here is a link for 20 $Victory coins&lt;/a&gt; for the first 50 of you that are fast enough to claim them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Most &lt;strong&gt;Entrepreneurs try to "become rich"&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 just from their work: their Startup, their business, their "job". But I can tell you that from my vast experience, most Entrepreneurs (me included) made a considerable amount of life-changing money from their companies but 🔟 times more through "other paths".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like my friend Michael (we never met, but I consider him a friend).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/n67UZO6OjveCgo5XWL0U2EgP2PYYGmmvPSqg6QAD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. He made tons of money by dunking on people's faces, but he made &lt;strong&gt;10x&lt;/strong&gt; while chilling at his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Like with &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nike&lt;/strong&gt;_and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Air Jordan's&lt;/strong&gt;_. Air Jordan's are a separate brand, and Michael makes 10% just because he is Michael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Also, Michael is an investor in Epic Games (the creator of Fortnite - a game that made $5 Billion a couple of years ago).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 Then he bought an NBA Team for $300M. That team (Charlotte Hornets) is worth around $2 Billion right now. He made more money with this than when he was an active basketball player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🔹 There are tons of other stories (like investing in a big NFT company, creating a NASCAR team, and tons more) that you can read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nathanbaugh27/status/1495764635085156355?t=xm6H7C3ZTiM20HMNkza5Qw&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;in this excellent Twitter thread.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I am trying to say is there are many ways to skin a cat. But you have to be a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ As you may know, &lt;strong&gt;I am obsessed with storytelling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Story telling + Commitment + Financial knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; are the only skills needed to create anything you want&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I heard that one of my favorite Film Makers / Storytellers (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Caseyneistatofficial"&gt;CaseyNeistat&lt;/a&gt;) - Casey - has a course, I knew I had to take it. I was concerned about the time commitment as the course goes non-stop for a whole month and is pretty brutal. Thankfully my wife Katya got it to me as a gift 🎁 so that I wouldn't make any excuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is that you'll learn how to improve your storytelling skills, and you'll create two short videos in 30 days. Long story short, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/u3VJo9evfVg"&gt;my first short video is here&lt;/a&gt;, and it is about &lt;strong&gt;garbage bins&lt;/strong&gt;🚮.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose a topic that is pretty boring to work on how I can make things interesting. Anyone can make a video about something exciting, but what about something that is painfully boring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that all my other videos will also improve. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;Let's talk about secret identities and Alter Egos.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/RvZ4lVctbYDGsOD8KbCSOfKDQv91HMiuGzPPqNXx16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alter-Ego-Effect-Identities-Transform/dp/0062838636/"&gt;The Alter Ego Effect&lt;/a&gt;, Todd Herman talks about how we can fabricate an alternative persona that is "better at the things we are not". You might know this as "fake it until you make it". Why do we want to do this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we end up becoming what we think we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps to try it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write down&lt;/strong&gt; what part you want to improve/change and &lt;strong&gt;why&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want to be more confident to be more social? Write this down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;strong&gt;crazy detailed image&lt;/strong&gt; of your Alter Ego. What "you" wear, drink, eat, watch TV, the music you hear, things you like, things you hate, places you want to go on vacations - the more detailed, the better. Let your imagination create a persona that would thrive in an environment where you have your challenges. Write this down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give your Alter Ego their &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-psychology-behind-superhero-origin-stories-4015776/"&gt;Heroic Origin Story&lt;/a&gt;. You need to have a glorious part. A past of successes and kicking ass. Create that past. Write it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, it has to be different.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find your &lt;strong&gt;cape&lt;/strong&gt;. Clark Kent (Superman) had glasses. You need to have an item that "activates" your persona. It is your costume. Some ideas are wearing a bracelet or a ring. When you wear the item, the Alter Ego is on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have everything visualize it. Read your notes every day and visualize that persona. It works spectacularly well in new places when people don't know you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea is that you harvest the "feelings" of that persona and not necessarily change your whole appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So next time you are on vacation, let your Alter Ego take control. Just don't try to fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;New York has its first "NFT ATM" 🏧, and it's really weird as its sounds!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://neonapp.com/"&gt;Neon&lt;/a&gt; is an NFT marketplace aiming to make buying an NFT "as simple as buying a toothbrush" – which means using an old-fashioned credit card and a literal, physical vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 So, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/28/nft-vending-machine-new-york-blockchain"&gt;what is it like to use a Vending Machine to buy NFTs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, it is fairly simple. You walk into an NFT ATM and buy one using your credit card. Currently, you can buy two different NFTs; "color" for $5.99 and a "party pigeon" for $420.69.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 But, what do I buy actually, and what can I do with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's impossible to own a color. What you own is a "proof of ownership" on the Solana blockchain that represents that particular color. 
People collect NFTs to trade them and sell them. Mostly, you are buying it to show it off, and there is no promise of future value. No one can ever sell you an NFT as a great investment. That's bulls**t. You should buy the art if you like it and connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Guess who is trying to copy my &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IHOP. 🥞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my European friends, IHOP is a huge restaurant that specializes in pancakes. IHOP decided to start &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/aliciakelso/2022/03/09/ihop-launches-a-new-digitally-enabled-loyalty-program/?sh=2f3d0b712acc"&gt;giving away PanCoins&lt;/a&gt; that you can redeem as coupons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, they don't have a fancy app as I do, but I am definitely going to add functionality to convert your $Victory to $PanCoins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, here is &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/clarkkent"&gt;a link for 10 $Victory coins&lt;/a&gt; for the first ten of you that is fast enough to claim them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks, you should be able to redeem 🎫 them for cool stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I am pretty sure you heard about&lt;strong&gt; what is going on the last couple of weeks in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;, so I will just add an interesting DAO called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO"&gt;UkraineDAO&lt;/a&gt;. 🇺🇦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A kickass art group (Pussy Riot) along with members from PleasrDAO - &lt;a href="https://jon.io/can-academics-build-products"&gt;that I talked about in a previous newsletter&lt;/a&gt; created a DAO to raise money, and they already raised $3M. 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you donate funds, you'll get back &lt;strong&gt;$LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is interesting how fast the web3 community created mechanisms to help people in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more about it &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/93787/pussy-riot-trippy-labs-pleasrdao-launch-ukraine-dao"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ If you are an &lt;strong&gt;Entrepreneur&lt;/strong&gt; and don't understand why &lt;strong&gt;storytelling&lt;/strong&gt; is the most important skill you should possess, go and become an employee or work in the public sector. Or become a VC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/W8pGyHP4PxU"&gt;In this week's video&lt;/a&gt;, I review a pitch deck that has a pretty good team, great business plan, traction but ... a weak pitch deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing is that you can always improve your story with minimal effort. But I've seen a lot of companies (especially in Europe) that put "the story" on the back burner and end up either not raising money or getting crushed by inferior competitors. I literally know three Startups with epic products but no "story" that got acquired for way less than their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/yypZfwilp93ohcernVqgOmjOQaFpxd1FiYlLtfFi16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/W8pGyHP4PxU"&gt;leave a comment on the video&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;The times have changed, and being an employee doesn't work for anyone.&lt;/strong&gt; There is plenty of funding and opportunities to build and secure your financial future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/tOoCg7ZmxtiN91xYnrRCmx0TmLdau41jJ177Us5016325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stay in the game by trying to learn and play with whatever new pops up. Most of the time, this leads to nothing, but I get an unfair advantage a couple of times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like when I started &lt;a href="https://jon.io/trading-ethereum-making-10-every-20-minutes"&gt;algotrading with Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; six years ago when Ether was at $8. Or when &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;I jumped into NFTs&lt;/a&gt; with my own platform and then with my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-organized-my-own-conference-like-gary-vee-in-30-days"&gt;own conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it doesn't always work, but you get a 100x return when it does. 📈&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found something before it becomes mainstream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I read a discussion on Linkedin about &lt;strong&gt;unlimited PTO (Paid Time Off)&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/msjessicamatos_pto-takevacation-takeabreak-activity-6898063129184497664-YP6H/"&gt;whether it is a scam.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can say that yes, it is a scam if you are a pushover employee. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with unlimited PTOs is that employees are psychologically forced not to use them. Or at least that's the idea. But the company &lt;strong&gt;is not to blame.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You and only you as an employee you have to set boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is up to you. The company's purpose is not to cuddle you. The sooner you get this, the faster you can start growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change your mentality from "oh, I have a lot of work I cannot get a vacation" to "I need time to recharge". &lt;strong&gt;Communicate and escalate.&lt;/strong&gt; A good manager wants you to be in your top performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you think your manager doesn't care, again communicate and escalate. Don't make assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you know that your manager won't do anything, well, time to look for a new job. Stop giving excuses to yourself and move. Start looking immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about unlimited PTOs? 💭&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Do you know what a ".eth" address is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're following the web3 community on Twitter, you will see that more and more people change their handling, adding a ".eth" suffix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/MRj0av3Bl3HgeZMguPLtschMFCCUXt259oFVOGfh16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/everything-you-can-do-with-your-ens-name-right-now-9a66763e970a"&gt;So, what is this address, where can you get yours, and what can you do with it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ens.domains/"&gt;ENS (Ethereum Name Space)&lt;/a&gt; is an Ethereum token that governs the Ethereum Name Service, a protocol for human-readable crypto addresses and decentralized domain names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ensdomains"&gt;An ".eth" domain&lt;/a&gt; is your web3 username. It gives you a decentralized naming for wallets, websites, &amp;amp; more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Name For All of Your Addresses.&lt;/strong&gt; 
No more copying and pasting long addresses. Use your ENS name to store all of your addresses and receive any cryptocurrency, token, or NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decentralised Websites&lt;/strong&gt;. Launch censorship-resistant decentralized websites with ENS. Upload your website to IPFS and access it with your ENS name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tor .onion websites.&lt;/strong&gt; Add a Tor .onion address to your ENS records in the Content field; then, if you are using the Tor Browser with MetaMask enabled, just enter the .ETH name in the URL bar, and it should resolve to the .onion website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text records&lt;/strong&gt; 📝 Text records functionality allows you to voluntarily add various kinds of personal information to your ENS records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You .eth address is an &lt;strong&gt;NFT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make your NFT your ENS &lt;strong&gt;Profile Avatar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week, my friend Kyriakos suggested playing a video game called &lt;strong&gt;"Vampire Survivors"&lt;/strong&gt;. I think games are interactive movies, and creating an addictive and interesting game requires a lot of skills. Most of these skills apply to Startups, businesses even life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/DQX2psC1A2Z9sfJOinyKsiqtzGkwkn2ENCLhs4kK16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vampire Survivors is a very simple game. Very simple graphics. Very simple story. Trivial to learn and play. The game is still in "alpha version" meaning that it hasn't been released fully yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And it is already insanely successful with more than 77k players per day!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante"&gt;Slaying monsters in Vampire Survivors is like walking through a casino&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/vampire-survivors-indie-game/"&gt;It is a dopamine hit&lt;/a&gt;. The game costs $3 and has generated at this moment millions in revenue without being out yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you watch the game on YouTube (don't download it, you'll lose your sleep), you'll see simple mechanics and low-quality graphics. What is remarkable is that this little $3 game is more engaging than other games that had a $100M budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🎯 My point? Focus on providing value. Money doesn't buy value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In this week's video, I talk about the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knfsx0KisV4"&gt;three things I learnt from pitching to tons of Silicon Valley VCs.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;⚠️ There are not the usual stuff you read on blog posts. ⚠️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/Y4FuHl90Tt6lBTyRrk1y4MqFftcwZ3SQn7BNLViu16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knfsx0KisV4"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;strong&gt;This email has generated $4B revenue.&lt;/strong&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is Amazon's email about the price increase of Amazon Prime. Just like that. One email and tons of money hitting the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/eUYJW8vjxIdaF6FMEhNx3Mwfwn3XVXARXJU6t7ny16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love subscription products!&lt;/strong&gt; But not all companies can pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen tons of companies trying to increase prices, and most of them are welcomed by backlash and lowered sales. How is Amazon doing it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon tries to integrate its services as close as possible into our everyday life. They try to become essential. The moment it is more painful waiting 5 days for your delivery than paying a few dollars per year, Amazon turns into a painkiller than a vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe vitamins are good for you, but when you have a headache, you'll give anything to make it stop. These are the best products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See originally on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/c_gro/status/1494804477857067010?s=20&amp;amp;t=4c1gVrEMpgOU0BukASBSvg"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;strong&gt;My Social token $Victory ($✌️) went live this week!&lt;/strong&gt; 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and starting next week; I'll start posting videos and YouTube Live describing how I made,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the web3 app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the smart contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the marketing and design behind it
and tons more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🛒I hope I'll start adding things that you can &lt;strong&gt;"buy"&lt;/strong&gt; with your $Victory in the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, you can &lt;strong&gt;claim for free 99 $Victory by following &lt;a href="https://victory.jon.io/claim/firstdrop"&gt;this link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; 🔗&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💡I would love to hear your feedback and ideas on how this currency can be used (trust me, I have 1000 ideas)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Building prototypes is my favorite thing.&lt;/strong&gt; ⚒️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; exploring customer dynamics and behaviors, and I launch hundreds of tiny prototypes every year to verify my assumptions (I learnt that the hard way after spending tons of time building products that no one wanted)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://paulshustak.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-designing-and-testing-mvps-88cc12118a16"&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; is from my friend Paul, a kickass Product Manager, about building MVPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite is the "Piecemeal MVP". Which one is your favorite❓&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This is how Coinbase made (probably) a 20x return from their ad in &lt;strong&gt;Super Bowl.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you spend $6M for a 30-second ad? 🤔&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it might sound stupid, but these are the prices you pay to advertise during the biggest athletic event in the U.S. - the Super Bowl. This year, most ads were about electric vehicles and (of course) crypto, with Coinbase stealing the show. If you haven't watched Coinbase's ad, you can see it below (yes, that is the ad).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/eZLG9iVwUcCQ9v8RsjEaoJVD4V9oPv2a61QNsg8D16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But did Coinbase ad make any money?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lifetime Value of a customer for Coinbase is &lt;strong&gt;$250 (on average)&lt;/strong&gt;. To break even, Coinbase will need &lt;strong&gt;24k new users.&lt;/strong&gt; But they also gave away &lt;strong&gt;$15&lt;/strong&gt; to each user so let's say &lt;strong&gt;26k new users&lt;/strong&gt; to break even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, an ad has a 1% to 3% conversion rate (and usually ads, where you give away money, have a higher conversion rate). Let's go with a 0.5% conversation rate to be very conservative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total eyeballs that watched Super Ball were 117M. That means 117M * 0.5% = &lt;strong&gt;585k new converted users&lt;/strong&gt; which translates a &lt;strong&gt;~20x return of investment (ROI)&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, 20x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coinbase spent $6M and probably "made" ~ $120M&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn't sound stupid, right? 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S.: The calculations are ballpark (Super Bowl park!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ During my last couple of emails, I told you about &lt;strong&gt;$Victory coins&lt;/strong&gt; - my social currency - and I've promised you to send you some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, I have news! This week I'll post on my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; the official link that you can go and &lt;strong&gt;claim your free $Victory coins plus places you can spend them!&lt;/strong&gt; And if you've sent me an email in the past to claim your $Victory, you'll get another link too! And there is more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have documented the whole process in a mini-YouTube series where I go over&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to create your own currency,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to create your own web3 app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to design it and market it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All. Of. It. Just &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;subscribe on my channel&lt;/a&gt;, so you don't miss this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://github.com/jonromero/jonio_website/blob/master/content/images/youtube/youtube_cover_image.png?raw=true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Most of you are sending me emails about exciting things you found. And I want to include you in the process (and give you some sweet $Victory!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a small paragraph about something that you found interesting in Startups, Products, web3, or Crypto and &lt;strong&gt;get 10 $Victory&lt;/strong&gt;, go to &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/oNmbWDjPeu5TjezY8"&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; and submit a story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I choose to include your paragraph in the newsletter, I'll send you 10 $Victory, mention you on my newsletter, Linkedin (and sometimes Twitter and Instagram).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's see how that goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Let me introduce you to your new obsession: the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead Internet Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theory (or should I say conspiracy theory?) talks about how the internet is fake, and most interactions come from an A.I. that has been taken over. Follow up the rabbit hole; it is quite interesting - unless you don't really exist, and I am posting just for the amusement of bots (unless I am also a bot 🤖!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ If you've never been to Disneyland, I can assure you it is a pretty fun place (I prefer the one in France btw). But some people really really really want their everyday Disney dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why Disney decided to create a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937210/disney-residential-communities-storyliving-cotino-planned-town"&gt;Storyline community&lt;/a&gt; where you can buy (or rent) a house and live next to Goofy, Micky, and Mini!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it's your move Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ There is &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt; better than starting your day with a hilarious conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the story of how two hackers stole &lt;strong&gt;4 Billion in Bitcoin&lt;/strong&gt; 💰 and got arrested by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/QVS9Bn3ZMRjQL459GGU63u7H0tx07Q7cGkQ2j0un16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016, a cryptocurrency exchange was hacked and 4.5 Billion dollars (in Bitcoin) went poof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authorities were watching in awe the masterminds that hacked the exchange and were using algorithmic trading programs, dark pools, chain hopping and all these extremely sophisticated technics in order to elude the tight grasp of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of a sudden, these hackers started buying NFTs, $500 Wallmart cards and posting on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/liz_franczak/status/1491109758035968000?s=20&amp;amp;t=2eGgDswEDuQX0fOSqspLSQ"&gt;Tik Tok hilarious videos&lt;/a&gt;. And of course the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sbc4eaNevjU"&gt;most epic video you can imagine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us recap: a super highly technological group of hackers, posts cringe-worthy videos, goes to &lt;strong&gt;hide in New York&lt;/strong&gt;, knows from November that are under investigation (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ckreimendahl/status/1491252846624665600?s=20&amp;amp;t=2eGgDswEDuQX0fOSqspLSQ"&gt;but doesn't seem to care&lt;/a&gt;) and they get hacked by the FBI because they kept the keys to their 4 Billion dollars &lt;strong&gt;IN DROPBOX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have watched the links above, you can see there is no chance that these people are even capable of using a pen so hacking crypto-exchanges and taunting FBI is out of their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being wealthy and unknown is better than rich and famous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Switching gears! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPk6xsXwtz8"&gt;In this week's video&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about five mistakes that every Entrepreneur does - and obviously I have done in the past. &lt;strong&gt;But that's how you learn!&lt;/strong&gt;
I am going to do a series with all the things I've learnt (talking to Silicon Valley VC, raising money, losing money etc) so make sure you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;subscribe to the channel&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the video. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/4qycswX7Wbh3wewKqQ4Uo8j5U2plKiHvf3ZxbWs016325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A lot of people tell me that they are not cut for Entrepreneurship. They want the financial security a company can provide.
I can tell you that if I managed to build and run companies then anyone can do it. Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial security is a myth. &lt;strong&gt;You and only you&lt;/strong&gt; can control your financial well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/9/22926095/peloton-ceo-all-hands-fired-employees"&gt;Peloton decided to fire 2800 people in one go&lt;/a&gt;. But at least everyone got a free membership. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60059259"&gt;Zoom fired 900 people over a ... Zoom call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working for a company is trading your time for a 10% of your value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Guess who is going into the Metaverse? &lt;strong&gt;Apple!&lt;/strong&gt; It seems a new VR headset will be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/09/apple-realityos-ar-vr-headset-reference/"&gt;released this or next year&lt;/a&gt;. Why you say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook knows that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/meta-may-pull-facebook-instagram-from-europe-over-data-rules"&gt;the days of web2 are numbered&lt;/a&gt;. People want more immersion, more connectivity. And 1 billion in revenue kind of proves that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/92566/gucci-buys-land-ethereum-the-sandbox-metaverse-experiences"&gt;And Gucci just bought some land in the Metaverse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most things seem silly until we fully understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ On the other hand, it is always good to be aware that "what goes up, goes down". Tim O'Reilly who coined the term &lt;strong&gt;Web 2.0&lt;/strong&gt; talks about the crash that is going to &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cryptocurrency-nft-blockchain-web3-tim-oreilly/"&gt;inevitably come to the crypto space.&lt;/a&gt;
Or he is just angry that we moved to web3 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about being right but being right at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These are the highlights of the past week!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Let's talk about expensive bags and their "underground story".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a brand that sells bags for $13k to $2M. Yes, I know. Who wants an expensive bag when you can buy &lt;a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-sold-for-2-85-million-in-eth/"&gt;an NFT with that kind of money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the interesting part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot just "walk" into a shop and buy this bag. There is a waiting list, and usually, it is 5 years (or way more). I am talking about the &lt;a href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/story/106191-birkin/"&gt;Birkin bags&lt;/a&gt;.
There are a couple of tricks to get higher on the list and sometimes get one on the spot. The easiest way is to be a man.
Based on some super underground info (Reddit), a man that buys a Birkin bag as a gift won't overthink it and won't have any special requirements (color, fabric, etc.). It is a much easier and faster sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In the latest video, I review the pitch deck of a Startup that almost every engineer I know wanted to build something similar; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51AIADVpv4"&gt;A one-page website generator&lt;/a&gt;
And this company nails it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;💬 Please leave a comment on the video. I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/npoNFQV2Fii9Lla8iBgM9hucWqcSJ0I0og5K2O9x16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k51AIADVpv4"&gt;Click to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I have played Wordle once. If you don't know what Wordle is, welcome back from the cave you've been in the last couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engineer built a super simple game for his partner during the pandemic in order to kill time. The game is extremely addictive, and for this reason, he decided that you can play only once per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game went viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition"&gt;New York Times just acquired the game.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wordle is the definition of KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. If something has value for people, you don't need fancy websites, marketing, or crazy funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ It was 2013, and I was in San Francisco reading the news about a European program that was going to "fund" new VCs. This would have been the beginning of the Startup community in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that most of these "VCs", were cookie-cutters: no Entrepreneurial background, no investing background. To kickstart a revolution, a radical change, you need people that take insane risks and act before anyone else does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need leaders, not followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to start my own "fund" with zero money. I called it &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/zerofund"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"The ZeroFund"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and I was giving zero money for zero equity. Yes, zero for zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was giving something more important than anyone else. Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;process&lt;/strong&gt; to be part of ZeroFund was the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to register your company (for free) on the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You were sent a website template (one-pager), and you had to fill it up with images/videos/photos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You had to "rally" to bring visitors to your website, and they could pledge "virtual money". If you managed to raise more than the threshold, you were going to the Stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Stage was a live event, where you had to present your company live to all your supporters. Then you had to raise $700 from them, something that would give you access to a co-working space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This superfast process forced you to &lt;strong&gt;launch&lt;/strong&gt;, look for &lt;strong&gt;users&lt;/strong&gt; and get your first "paying" &lt;strong&gt;customers&lt;/strong&gt;, all while supporting co-working spaces and making your product known. What else do you want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZeroFund went viral.&lt;/strong&gt; Google and Microsoft donated servers. Hundreds of people started following the companies. A-List mentors joined to help the Startups (CTO of AOL, right-hand man of Bill Gates, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.). An accelerator in Silicon Valley flew the companies to a pitch-deck retreat in Italy. And one Startup got funding - and they made it to Series B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund was all about zero sum: We all win when we all win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never gave money, but we provided access to a huge network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We never took a percentage, but we got to meet some epic people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I remember this after 9 years?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these companies &lt;a href="https://www-benzinga-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.benzinga.com/amp/content/25331804"&gt;got acquired for $75M yesterday.&lt;/a&gt; Insane. 🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZeroFund during the years took different forms, and occasionally I get an email about restarting it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🤔 Maybe now with crypto, it could be even easier. Or maybe there is no need because there are so many VCs out there. Or perhaps now it is a bigger need than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your thoughts about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7FsOu7aO1A"&gt;This is a video (in Greek) that covers ZeroFund on the Stage day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Meet  &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela"&gt;Miquela&lt;/a&gt;. Miquela is a &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Influencer&lt;/strong&gt;. That means that she is not real. Actually, the girl behind her is also not real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/15DuXsCKCePaJMiIpvU4Jqm9Q894kwgJotplWO9E16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miquela has a YouTube channel, video clips, a hit on Spotify, and in 2020, she made $11M. And she is not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Influencers are becoming more common, and people are obsessing over them. Even &lt;a href="https://www.virtualhumans.org/article/jennifer-aniston-launches-virtual-pet-clydeo"&gt;Jennifer Aniston&lt;/a&gt; launched a Virtual Influencer (hint: it is a dog 🐶).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do people really care about something that is not real?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the story telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People love stories. It puts our brain into a different mode. And this is what I've been saying to all Entrepreneurs: "Sell the story then build the product."
Even if you have no interest in influencers, it is a masterclass in building a brand, storytelling, and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really live in exciting times 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

Let's jump straight to the top …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This is the story, how a DAO bought the wrong item, at the wrong price, for the wrong reasons and lost $3M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple newsletters ago, I talked about how a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/can-academics-build-products"&gt;DAO bought the unreleased album of Wu-Tang from FBI for $4M&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, a lot of stuff were bought from DAOs but one of them was &lt;strong&gt;remarkably stupid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If for whatever reason you don't know what a DAO is, check &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;this video I made for you&lt;/a&gt;. Back to our story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SpiceDAO is a DAO with the simple mission to buy the book of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(novel)"&gt;"Dune"&lt;/a&gt;. Money were raised, high fives were given but something went wrong. Very wrong.
First, the bought the wrong book. Instead of buying the &lt;strong&gt;Frank Herbert’s&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, they bought the hilarious film adaptation of  &lt;strong&gt;Jodorowsky’s&lt;/strong&gt; Dune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't know about Jodorowsky's adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cJNR8HEw0"&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt;. Personally I believe it is a (hilarious) masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more. Oh, there is more.
The idea was that, after the acquisition of the book, they can create NFTs based on it's chapters and then burn the book! Then it only exists in the &lt;em&gt;metaverse&lt;/em&gt;. 
The issue of course is that when you buy something, &lt;strong&gt;you don't own the IP&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, if I buy a BMW I cannot start selling t-shirts with BMW's logo! 
Sadly, the DAO learnt about this after acquiring the book for $3M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I know what you are thinking right now. They can still sell the book back right? 
&lt;strong&gt;Nope&lt;/strong&gt;. The actual book costs $30k. Yes, &lt;strong&gt;$30k&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's ok, &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/a38815538/dune-crypto-nft-sale-mistake-explained/"&gt;we all do mistakes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ This week, we broke the 300 subscribers on my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/youtube"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. I am loving it! If you haven't subscribed, consider doing it - it is awesome stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest video, I review the pitch deck of a Startup that kept me excited during the whole time. Very nice pacing and metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please leave a comment &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mM_MGWt8DrE"&gt;on the video&lt;/a&gt;, I would love to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/itPjpQ8TMSXxH7Rv0LLrMYCbpzL6d7524T0oZBLW16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/mM_MGWt8DrE"&gt;Click to see this epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ If I read back to you the following sentence a couple years ago, you would be looking at me like I am a crazy person.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Meta (Facebook) has created a &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/facebook-parent-meta-creates-powerful-ai-supercomputer-to-support-metaverse-01643061310"&gt;supercomputer A.I to support the Metaverse&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's go through this again.
Facebook, oh sorry I meant Meta, has created the fastest supercomputer with A.I (whatever that means) to support the metaverse - whatever the metaverse might be. 
If they have added "&lt;strong&gt;web3&lt;/strong&gt;" and "&lt;strong&gt;DAO&lt;/strong&gt;" they would have ticked all the boxes 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ It seems that DAOs are making VCs even more irrelevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you shouldn't need to raise outside money because you can raise faster from your community. And now, you can start your own "VC" with a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://syndicate.io/"&gt;SyndicateDAO&lt;/a&gt; - (disclosure: I am somewhat affiliated with them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/zdQrIEqc40Ij0bzhaU7N1f55ZYZ6xRSq9zQskWB816325"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SyndicateDAO"&gt;SyndicateDAO&lt;/a&gt; you can create an investment DAO and invite friends to invest with you. And no, this is not a paid advertisement as there are still tons of issues (see: regulations).
You can picture it as &lt;a href="https://angel.co/"&gt;AngelList&lt;/a&gt; but faster, cheaper and more transparent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we do a Syndicate for the companies that I review on my YouTube channel - and make sense to invest in? What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ To make it big in life, you need to take risks. Build your own company, invest aggressively, shoot for the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk took "the shoot for the moon" part, a bit literally as one of the SpaceX's rockets will &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-60148543"&gt;crash into the moon and explode&lt;/a&gt;. 
Well at least it won't come &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3wZRdg-Tmo"&gt;crashing down back to Earth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Do you want to make $1M 💰 while sitting in front of your computer? Take a selfie! 🤳&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Indonesian college student decided to take one selfie every day for three years (or 993 days to be exact). Then, because he wanted to learn about NFTS, he decided to release them as an NFT collection. That collection just broke &lt;strong&gt;$1M in sales&lt;/strong&gt;. Crazy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you are wondering how he did that, he shared exactly his process on how to make $1M with NFTs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there were more than 230+ sold, and I still don't understand why you want to buy NFT photos of me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ This week review the pitch deck of a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1vS17uiDw"&gt;Startup that has a great idea but the pitch deck is ... very weak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's ok! That's why I am doing these videos and I am sure that with a little bit of love (and hype!), they can make an excellent pitch deck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion, so please leave a comment on the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/EuxZl71RpSYveMKJTXH05pF6TfiOqV4NfYzaAPUg16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU1vS17uiDw"&gt;See this epic video here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog?sub_confirmation=1"&gt;DO IT NOW.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Have you ever watched Shark Tank, the show where Startups pitch their ideas and four investors decided whether to put money or not? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/video/413391"&gt;GoingPublic&lt;/a&gt;, a show where the &lt;strong&gt;viewer&lt;/strong&gt; can also invest from their couch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is thanks to a new regulation in the US, where anyone can invest without being a "professional investor" or any specific (high) income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you ever invest in any companies from "Shark Tank"? Why now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ World of Women is an NFT collection that has taken over the Internet ($21M in sales). 
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ReeseW"&gt;Reese Witherspoon&lt;/a&gt; is a big promoter along with tons of other Celebrities and as it was expected we are going to have the first NFTs &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/90379/world-of-women-ethereum-nfts-surge-bored-apes-hollywood?amp=1"&gt;making it into Hollywood movies&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and yes, we checked that this project is actually made "by women" as in the past &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/78329/ethereum-nft-fraud-fame-lady-squad"&gt;another project&lt;/a&gt; claimed it was by women (it was not) and after they got exposed they handed over the project to a women's group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/xkbqXNdGKlEFAQEMseSFyo2PpE9VO9tZZqxYdr4716325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ &lt;strong&gt;Instagrammers. Cloning. Dead Pets.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much crazier this 2022 could get? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/pet-cloning-becomes-more-popular-instagrammers-begin-replicating-deceased-pets-1670491"&gt;cloning pets&lt;/a&gt; has become pretty popular. And it is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; expensive. 
A cloning company says that the prices are around $50k for a dog, $35k for a cat and $45k for a horse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story in the article above, talks about a cat that had around 45k followers and sadly died. The owner decided to clone the dead cat which now shares an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/adogandacat/"&gt;account with a dog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This week I review the pitch deck of a Startup that wants to make it easier for you to buy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ"&gt;Real Estate ... in the Metaverse!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the idea but there is an issue that I haven't talked about in any other video and it has to do with Startups that have only &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion, so please leave a comment on the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Mud9dYrfZCNyBu_E4b8MVyIAZ1qNy7aW__CyR3l6ieAH_iNv3VotVbSoDF0f2u_29MAxual5JyDJBHHGF1tpdRN__3MJU0BCgDZzhzbLQVJQDVcptUQLMp95P5gBI-Bvse_0ZQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/JEmgROsGWr8jN0Y3Hz2eytcgJWN7IEoAL1K2zYK316325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/wlyq86"&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Ready to have your mind blown into pieces? 🤯&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3162257/chinese-scientists-build-factory-robot-can-read-minds-assembly"&gt;China has built a factory robot that reads minds&lt;/a&gt;.
Why? So it can predict their needs you silly! And here is the scenario.
You want a wrench? Why lose those precious 3 seconds to think and act when &lt;strong&gt;a machine can sense your needs and grab it for you&lt;/strong&gt;? Isn't all about optimization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to hear your opinion about this - let me know what you think at 📥 me@jon.io&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ What is Wrong with Being Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people never work as hard as they do when they are trying to prove themselves right. &lt;strong&gt;But not you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you will catch yourself caring more about being right than to get the best possible outcome, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;STOP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I want to be right? Or do I care more about creating the best possible work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be unbeatable, you have to give up on always trying to "be right" and &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOCUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on what truly matters. Don't get trapped on the &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/"&gt;Wrong Side of Right!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Whoa! Today we made it to number (4) without talking about NFTs! Let's change that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have any idea how big was the creators' economy using Ethereum in 2021? Take a guess, I'll wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1479478884072505346?t=KfQ9krEz3uTOgdUMzP9yig&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;3.5 Billion&lt;/a&gt; 💰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INSANE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gets me very sad when I see people missing out on this great wealth shift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Oh who knew! &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-floyd-mayweather-jr-sued-for-allegedly-making-false-statements-about-the-crypto-ethereummax-11641918153"&gt;Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather Jr. sued for involvement in alleged crypto scam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CityDAO/status/1480421505385197575?s=20"&gt;Tons of hacks&lt;/a&gt; in the crypto space and a lot of scams going around so be EXTREMELY careful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that matters in the end is community and adoption. Anything else is just hype and sophisticated scams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week. 🚀&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ There is a famous A.I paradigm called "This X doesn't exist". For example if you go to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/74o2or"&gt;https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/&lt;/a&gt;, you will see a new face generated using A.I every time. You can do the same for &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/ynolod"&gt;cats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/rvnonz"&gt;Startups&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/op0609"&gt;resumes&lt;/a&gt; and I even had my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/qwzn6g"&gt;own for products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one of them is terrifying. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gxd2"&gt;This climate does not exist&lt;/a&gt;. It is using A.I to show you how YOUR home (or any address or monument you like) is when climate conditions go astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/2yj207"&gt;Monastiraki in Athens/Greece&lt;/a&gt;, a very popular place near Acropolis - almost underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/S3nt-znUg7BCAPuZU0iy0Z7HQ4db7255bQTN3AJD9jtT6fxQMcnWDvQf7WprCW3W7TttQh46K_GtgMIdVGAccjuHcGHYPAft5sVSsWYD5Ifxl9szRXTAfKoMa9zMT-4Y7Y9wTQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/F8xmYNiBdy80TceBrrSebwST8wMAG2yGsdeEZf5I16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Ozzy Osborne launched an NFT project and &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gex8"&gt;the video is hilarious&lt;/a&gt;. More than 70k have joined the Discord in one day, waiting to buy CryptoBatz (yes, blood thirsty pixelated bats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least is WAY better than &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/nne26v"&gt;Matt Damon's embarrassing ad for Crypto.com&lt;/a&gt; which personally I liked but but &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/llx6y0"&gt;most of the Internet has gone ballistic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Remember when &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/rvnyo9"&gt;I joined a DAO that raised ~$10M and bought some real estate in Wyoming&lt;/a&gt; to build a Metacity? Well, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/op055o"&gt;another DAO is buying golf courses&lt;/a&gt; and they just raised $10M in 48 hours by selling NFTs. And another wants to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/zpg22w"&gt;purchase a dead brand and relaunch it as a streaming service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn't this space absolutely crazy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ But what is more interesting is a story from my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/qwzggv"&gt;NFT platform&lt;/a&gt; (I need to write a whole book about these stories):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was summer of 2021 and we were selling exclusively Celebrity NFTs. That meant talking and meeting celebrities, their manager and with their agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, after we decided to drop all custom projects and just provide services for creators and APIs for platforms, we started printing money (ether). Back to the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the top five agencies in LA (and dare to say in the world?) approached us for another project. And based on our past experiences, agencies (and specifically Celebrities) don't know how to sale NFTs or interact with their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were approached to assist with the drop of photos taken by a photographer of a dead Celebrity. Of course there was no community behind this (&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gee8"&gt;it is one of the five deadly sins of selling NFTs&lt;/a&gt;). And of course they wanted to sale at a crazy price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that we were not a good fit and told them as a friendly advice not to use OpenSea but another platform (again, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/84gee8"&gt;using OpenSea is another deadly sin&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short and $1M spent in marketing after using OpenSea, they sold &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny story is that this happened three times. Three. Freaking. Times. Millions of dollars spent and zero sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh well. You pay and you learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ This week I review the pitch deck of a 100% &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/9r5k7y"&gt;Bamboo Toilet Paper company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, the deck had some issues the first five slides but then OMG it turned around! One slide made the whole difference and someone from my team will reach out to learn more information. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/ej47qplz/9r5k7y"&gt;Check the video here&lt;/a&gt; and there is surprise as always ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/exWJyKWmQ9UWoJVf_fOJiNuIXa7Hr4zTggyhmSPl-2FIauNObvywzq7OxPdk6wW5ng1CNdqZRbZKXiXWG1aA4l-ZpKmK0j24mGSHEtiGm8CAGjlNr0iLEEkxppKzOir7j6_6yQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/WsptagY8wlLNc5IfxY4gZexn0BDb98GSd6Ojbudy16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week I had &lt;strong&gt;Live Office hours&lt;/strong&gt; and we talked about …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the top five things for this week. Oh and Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last week I had &lt;strong&gt;Live Office hours&lt;/strong&gt; and we talked about Web3 for Entrepreneurs! &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRa8xC9chk"&gt;Here is the full video&lt;/a&gt; where I cover Web3, best DAOs, what a DAO is and tons of other questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/nMnAXvT59JImmAb4xX7C1Pm5eQ6Su0Sv80r2qyQn16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRa8xC9chk"&gt;Check the video here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In case you don't know, we have a DAO - called &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;KaramelaDAO&lt;/a&gt;. On our twitter we talk about how we built our DAO and we have a DAO Historian that writes &lt;a href="https://mirror.xyz/karameladao.eth"&gt;once per week about the cool things that we build&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/gJb2St9fMCb3P5TaOGxU1B706yEds2o54dnkfTf116325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to have a small community of 300 people that get to build interesting stuff and experiment with these new social structures. ]&lt;a href="https://discord.gg/rcMREKNA3X"&gt;Join us on our Discord if you want to check it out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_startups-founders-activity-6832905191004753920--LCW"&gt;When I first asked Entrepreneurs to send me their pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I'll review them, I had no idea I'll be doing YouTube videos for two months and have 600+ pitch decks in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that's not the awesome part. Today I am happy to announce that I am an investor to one of the companies that I reviewed on my channel, &lt;a href="https://www.zenus.ai/"&gt;Zenus.AI&lt;/a&gt;. The pitch deck if you want to check it out is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUlE3gDqrvQ"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is something even awesomer. Three investors reached out to me after watching the pitch deck and now they are also investors in Zenus.AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still &lt;a href="https://jon.io/startup-office-hours"&gt;send me your pitch deck here&lt;/a&gt; and I'll review it some time in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ DAOs are the hottest thing right now (&lt;a href="https://jon.io/becoming-a-genius-robots-in-preschools-and-daos-against-hedge-funds"&gt;as I have been saying for the last two months&lt;/a&gt;) mostly because they introduce new business metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a DAO to work, you need to have an MLC - a Minimum Lovable Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ctt.ac/2CKFk"&gt;Click here to share it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do you really know what a DAO is and how they started?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;new video&lt;/a&gt; that is "different" from my previous ones. I would love to hear what you think about it as I really like this style but definitely I need more work to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch it and tell me if it was captivating or if you got bored. I really want to know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/ykGfa11YOedNq6qYrDgniy1EzMLxeGjT7T8rzuD516325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://%20https//www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc"&gt;Watch it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Story time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban almost never invests in other people's funds because "he doesn't enjoy it" but he invested $6M in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Backstage_Cap"&gt;Backstage Capital&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1475879762895593472?t=6QGdkDK1GF60yg1Gn810NA&amp;amp;s=19"&gt;the founder asked him why&lt;/a&gt;, he said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re in rooms I’ll never be in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to make a 10x difference? Leave the room you are, either it is a town, country or company and &lt;strong&gt;be in the "future" room&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next year!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start with the highlights this week - oh and Merry Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ In 6 hours from now, I will be having &lt;strong&gt;Live&lt;/strong&gt; Office hours on YouTube, talking about Web3, NFTs and DAOs answering your questions! Let me know if I should be doing more Live Office hours about Startups, Crypto and other futuristic topics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/vqdj8d"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; and then on the "Reminder on" button! It is going to be super fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u8CGr5rbrnun2QEHkhlKAOl6vQDdZKIK4A4ijAaKgDZdZcIQblz8969DpRnoBzhhuMJobqRafoyD7E2X_nZ3R_QMOeglzzZFVbCi9OOnfdsGzB7THDeVmgKrEtQN6_0xkM0Ofg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/nMnAXvT59JImmAb4xX7C1Pm5eQ6Su0Sv80r2qyQn16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/vqdj8d"&gt;This Live&lt;/a&gt; will be recorded, edited and posted some time in future but I highly suggest you watch it live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week I posted about $Victory coins and that whoever posts on social media "I am Victorious" and tags me is going to get 100 $Victory coins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've seen you and I'll reach out in the next couple of weeks, asking for your Ethereum address to send you your coins. To the people that watched my previous videos and requested to send them a song, it is coming this week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the people that found the "secret" messages on the videos, I've sent them a &lt;strong&gt;physical gift&lt;/strong&gt; but I have NO IDEA why it takes sooo much time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 will have tons of surprises. Trust me on this. It is going to be beyond epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I found on Twitter, this AMAZING image with the 20+ Powerful Paradoxes of life. My favorite is the "Fear Paradox". Which one is yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/PKnb89o5FDQtZeQlapf350_JcR0B4cUiby-tjYrjbndvOpNH9FdTnsOzblm6IungdtpkCu6acW9Yjz7MboVffrsaBEKgruwouKg95jnR1cbKZE8GuOSBUXmYxaV9SAC4Zf0Tkw=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/55FXEIhZcJbSRt5ZicFvxhsbrOZXg58xZlveib0T16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very successful Entrepreneur told me that she reads this once every week. It helps her regain focus and slow down. Maybe this is one of your New Year's Resolutions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Jack (the founder of Twitter) got &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/xzdqrp"&gt;trashed on Twitter while venting for web3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/YN1C_Ok7AcGiYbrA9RNH7j6i8t7AEorWimblER14HDG0mFT8boYon3KEOCUN2DUs06NkiK_CGWrMnWAum-Q6qzq2ukFypiI32qq8NslUURyUNRjw4v8BXaZa5yo-EpopEkNPww=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/XGzT0O3ZocX6IaGYkhix3tIwcEkYWdFGhKsQ0SiD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that he violated the first rule of Web3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community &amp;gt; VCs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the majority of Web3 projects, no VC/Angel funding is needed. Actually it is a huge red flag. Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that a Startup needs to do is &lt;strong&gt;fail&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, fail. It took me a lot of time to get this into my mind as I was poisoned by my European mentality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/llq5n6"&gt;Building Startups to Fail&lt;/a&gt; means to do things that are not scalable. Things that will crash &lt;strong&gt;because you have too many customers&lt;/strong&gt;. And Web3 projects either have an insane amount of customers (that usually pay or can be monetized easily) or none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional funding model doesn't apply here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product market fit in Web3 means "printing money". Product market fit in Web2 is your first 100 (free) subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ In related news, the Twitch co-founder Justin Kan, after selling Twitch to Amazon for almost $1 Billion, he spent some time chilling and decided to enter the NFT space with a new Startup: &lt;strong&gt;Fractal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is very nice (selling NFTs as game assets) but not even &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/54zgyl"&gt;a week after the launch, $150k were stolen&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Because blockchain development is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/o65qjvn4/gvkznx"&gt;tons of executives and engineers are leaving their $500k per year jobs to jump into web3&lt;/a&gt;. By now I should be sounding like a broken record :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many things happened last week and I cannot wait to share them with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ This week I gave a talk about DAOs at the "Proof Of Consciousness", a Los Angeles/Venice DAO. &lt;a href="https://bit.ly/jondao11"&gt;Here are the slides&lt;/a&gt; and I recorded an epic video - hopefully to be released this week. It explains once and for all what a DAO is and how you can start working for one. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;Subscribe on my Youtube channel to get a notification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/fLHbj583xA888gQNT2y9ACjxVybTxgqX37fZsrGH16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week I posted about the DAO that we started - KaramelaDAO. We are building it in public - meaning that everything that we do is documented and shared. Now you can learn from our mistakes and see the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and below is the first designs for our NFT. If you want to get involved (we have tons of bounties!), &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;drop by our Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/gJb2St9fMCb3P5TaOGxU1B706yEds2o54dnkfTf116325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week we didn't have a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;weekly pitch deck reviews&lt;/a&gt; but oh, this week you are in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hes-launching-a-new-media-company-with-its-own-social-media-platform"&gt;Donald Trump has started a new media(?) company&lt;/a&gt; that hopes to replace Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon, Stripe, Google Cloud, AWS and Azure. I am not kidding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone sent me his pitch deck and ... (you know where this is going right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVWM00QjeY"&gt;I am reviewing Donald Trump's new pitch deck&lt;/a&gt;, without getting political, as I review every other single Startup. A lot of things to be learnt from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/9XwxSVcEKfw80xZx3iZOPnO69BNUoSUy1DBS4Nka16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVWM00QjeY"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ The last couple of months, my schedule grew back to its unsustainable form. Despite having outsourced almost &lt;strong&gt;everything&lt;/strong&gt; that is possible to be outsourced, I got involved again into to many epic projects. On top of that, there is a never-ending backlog with pitch deck reviews plus tons of other content waiting to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time for a clean up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to $Victory coins (yes, I am working on the name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You collect $Victory by reading my newsletters, by forwarding them, when you watch my YouTube videos until the end or have attended one of my talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can spent $Victory on pushing your pitch deck review higher on the list, get some &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; mentoring from me or redeem it with swag (NFT t-shirts!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $Victory coins are using a new smart contract from &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;, so expect delays and bugs until everything is shortened out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tag me on social media with the message "I want to be Victorious" and I'll send you 100 $Victory coins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I have one last thing to say and it is not financial advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838901/reddit-going-public-sec-s-1-filing-confidential"&gt;Reddit is going public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week with (hopefully) some $Victory!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Yesterday I gave a talk in &lt;a href="https://decentraland.org/"&gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt; about DAOs, &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; and the future …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Yesterday I gave a talk in &lt;a href="https://decentraland.org/"&gt;Decentraland&lt;/a&gt; about DAOs, &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; and the future of DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/oiaot0WcxrdulBUs3XRimSfJtxzhsPYrEIqMhMsp16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's my avatar in the photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn't manage to attend (probably because you are not following me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;) the highlights were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a strong cause behind what you do, people will join and help. It is not just about the money
Mistakes are bound to happen but as long as you made an informed decision, it is ok. You cannot predict the future and take into account unknown variables
Try to scale slowly. Going viral is most of the times a curse
Beware of the scammers. So many of them in the crypto space&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I posted a couple of weeks ago about a DAO that we are building. We have a name (KaramelaDAO) and a vibrant community that is operating semi-autonomously. We do at least two community calls per week so if you are interested in learning more about DAOs, the Metaverse and how we can take over a Greek Island and elected our own representative, &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;drop by our Discord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karameladao"&gt;DAO on Twitter too&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ The last couple of weeks, I keep hearing that working for a Web3 company is "dangerous". You can always be replaced on the spot or the company can fail and/or run out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce you to Better.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better.com is a well funded company that has 1 billion dollars and last week the &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/12/08/business/better-executive-resignations/index.html"&gt;CEO fired 900 people during a Zoom call&lt;/a&gt;. On the spot. Like, hey Merry Christmas for those that are not on this call because &lt;strong&gt;YOU&lt;/strong&gt; are fired. No reason. No explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least in a DAO you get to keep your governance token and vote rights and kinda know about these kind of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Oh Elon Elon Elon. At first you loved getting government money to build cool stuff but the moment the word "union" was heard you started thrashing around about inflation and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1468684576407101440"&gt;about the incentives other companies get to also build cool stuff&lt;/a&gt;. But that's ok. I still love you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I want to believe that money and resourcefulness solve everything but it seems that &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/neuralink-tesla-have-an-ai-problem-elons-money-cant-solve"&gt;A.I needs something more than money&lt;/a&gt; and that means that we won't get &lt;a href="https://neuralink.com/"&gt;Neuralink&lt;/a&gt; any time soon or self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But weirdest things have happened so who knows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Talking about weird stuff, I always found super strange that whenever Christies was selling some SUPER expensive multimillion NFT, there was always something fishy happening (sales not recorded on the blockchain, no open prices etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And behold, Christie decided to do some &lt;a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/market/christies-opensea-nft-sale-1234612759/amp/"&gt;sales directly on the blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it wasn't that impressive. At all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs were accused of being the perfect tool for money laundering but maybe there &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/15/opensea-admits-incident-as-top-exec-is-accused-of-trading-nfts-on-insider-information/"&gt;are more transparent that normal companies&lt;/a&gt; because of the huge community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for this week, see you next week with possibly a surprise ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ It has become a tradition by now, to have one &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; thing happening in the DAO space every week. This is the &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;fourth newsletter&lt;/a&gt; and trust me on this, I am not even talking about 1/64 of what is happening out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started helping out &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; with their Constitution smart contract and just like that I started another DAO, called DAOCracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of people helping out already, we had two community calls and I love it! If you want to participate and learn about web3, NFTs, the metaverse and how to work for a DAO, drop by our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; (channel #the-dao). I promise you, this DAO is for new people to learn more about this crazy new space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In the meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/el-salvador-plans-bitcoin-city-raise-1-billion-via-bitcoin-bond.html"&gt;El Salvador decided to create a "Bitcoin City"&lt;/a&gt; and raise $1 billion via "Bitcoin Bond". Translation: &lt;strong&gt;Scam&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no city being build that is not on the Ethereum blockchain and not using NFTs. Building a Bitcoin City makes as much sense as building a city using rocks. You can do it but you are probably an idiot. In this case, you cannot even build a city with Bitcoin as you cannot do any transactions and there are no smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ And we are back with our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;weekly pitch deck reviews&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I am reviewing a pretty solid Startup, with a very impressive technology. If I could change only one thing in their pitch deck that would be ... (come on, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXduZ4VdXCs"&gt;watch the video&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/hodzT9gEL9Ep5E2YVegFMT2GzrWiuZKqE1OA2SsY16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXduZ4VdXCs"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ If you don't know Mr Beast, oh you are in for a surprise. An excellent creator, that creates super viral videos. His last video is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg"&gt;Squid Games&lt;/a&gt;. 135 Million views in 7 days. Yes, he had more viewers that the actual Squid games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to create viral content, study him (I know I am!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ The founder of Twitter left Twitter. But that's not the big news. Jack Dorsey is also the founder of Square (a huge fintech company) that is now &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/dorsey-led-square-rebrands-block-2021-12-01/"&gt;rebranding to Block&lt;/a&gt;. Yes Block as in &lt;strong&gt;Block&lt;/strong&gt;chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still working for a web2 company, you have to &lt;strong&gt;immediately&lt;/strong&gt; reevaluate your choices. Join a DAO, and start reading as much as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a job in the future, you need to start working for the "future" - someone I don't remember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've been talking DAOs non-stop for the last three newsletters. And for a good reason because DAOs are the future of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week a &lt;a href="https://www.constitutiondao.com/"&gt;DAO decided to buy a copy of the American Constitution&lt;/a&gt;. They managed to raise $47M &lt;strong&gt;in a week&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790452/constitutiondao-loses-auction-for-rare-us-constitution-copy-sothebys"&gt;They lost the auction&lt;/a&gt; to the founder and CEO of Citadel - one of the biggest hedge funds on the planet. But what does this mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nvXtnQBggX-LXt8grO2n00LkeJkIYhuPtzMnPk66vLcERh31BYdzIssk9OhZy7QXnDkzIZwEht_utTb79m8GXzGTGCKAZJR_nQ1J63dsesFY84zt0RuyBJAtcOXMlGBu9IReqQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/1uIUdxGBQbVrdb55nP8L79fup8QqaLXgEwFL7djN16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DAOs can mobilize people (and money) extremely fast - faster than we have ever seen. The reason is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone is equal in the DAO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larger companies feel threatened as they cannot retain talented people and are left with those who "play it safe". Every single VC (that worth its salt) has switched to funding "Web3" companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DAOs pay better, are more fun to work with and provide more value than "web 2.0" companies. But of course there are downsides (which we'll talk about next week).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last week we had a &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; Los Angeles meetup. And it was epic. There I learnt about &lt;a href="https://mars.college/"&gt;Mars College&lt;/a&gt;, a Burning-Man-For-Hackers playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens there is that for three months, people that are creators, tinkers, thinkers, hackers and want to stretch their mind beyond the social norms, &lt;strong&gt;build a city&lt;/strong&gt;, create study groups and &lt;strong&gt;do deep work&lt;/strong&gt;. In the end of the "college", the city is torn down (like in Burning Man).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to rent a van and visit my friends in February, so if you want to come along just send me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Last week I took a break from reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo"&gt;pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I started doing small videos answering questions that came from you. That's what I did again this week (I promise, next week I'll go back to reviewing your pitch decks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/zp82yz"&gt;I rant about NDAs&lt;/a&gt; and why you might seem as "not knowing what you are doing" if you ask one from investors. Take a look (it's a 2-minute epic video with Los Angeles as the background).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, &lt;strong&gt;DO IT NOW&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/u0-JWQF3PGk0Cac0LegwXGSyMuN7KUmuoQz7g2fMsaIDEYaLu-e7J3SUt5_q45xlRkGmHNEUHXzojQROquz0xDJt54JpEoOYm-B2NqqPMdd3ndlbv88rpjT7qYdOxGaTbLVX1A=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/5nbwJB2xARLx1IU4hOqzml4nbxDnnErczzZgGn2g16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/zp82yz"&gt;Click here to see the epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ South Korea is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/jqvxoz"&gt;experimenting with small robots&lt;/a&gt; in pre-schools. Yes, you are in the Kindergarten and you are given a small robot in order to familiarize yourself with the future technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't start saying "when I was in the Kindergarten I used to run all day and play with my friends" because I am not stupid. Offering &lt;strong&gt;more knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deeper&lt;/strong&gt; understanding gives you an advantage. Like teaching your kids chess. Or a musical instrument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; more complex than the past. It is just moves faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I heard many times that I am a talented Entrepreneur, engineer or singer (ok, I've never heard the singer part). And whenever I say that "it is mostly hard work", I get the eyeroll. Here is an interesting story that proves that &lt;strong&gt;you are what you dedicate time on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, a psychologist decided to see if you are born a (chess) genius or you can become one. And he did what every normal person does: &lt;strong&gt;he put an ad to find a women to bear a child for him&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as all love stories go, he found one. And they had three girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He decided to teach all girls how to play chess. Oh an important part of the story: himself &lt;strong&gt;was not&lt;/strong&gt; a chess prodigy/genius/grandmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short the three girls, without having in their "DNA" the genius chromosome, they became chess prodigies and two of them are the first and second best chess players in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he had a trick to do that. A very simple trick. Deep, non-stop hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you find excuses, remember that is &lt;strong&gt;all you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/zlzdzjez/2yg52d"&gt;Read the story here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ The majority of people around us haven't been conditioned into taking action. That's why they have a hard time understanding what separates a good decision from a bad one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/yBm865Hw2k3wqSMFQ0D8NuygFzCqZDZ84TZt11dDI5En9D_bQGi51NjOP4fR_NlFwZ62dRcxmmJGa85I3SzRRIIe6NqX-lyfTgPiwUNQT-VHzjsafZBN8l6SmWJRw2pQ3bP6OA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/vnMHP1cRGbd4BNUq15aUUrfOhTFZlhwd4l7wT2rD16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision that takes a lot of time will end up in &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/p8ydlv"&gt;Analysis Paralysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision that tries to gather all data, it might no longer be beneficial as the landscape moves. Successful investments are done only with 20% of available information - before everybody else finds out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making decisions is more than data/facts collection. It is about &lt;strong&gt;execution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have this in the back of your mind when you try to find your next move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/54nlyq"&gt;Crypto Cities&lt;/a&gt; and more specifically about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/zp70oj"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt; (disclosure: I am affiliated with CityDAO). A week ago, we were 6000 Citizens planning how to build software to create a new city. This week we are 10k Citizens - and no more Citizens will be accepted at this moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am excited about DAOs is that I am working on launching a new DAO about the Metaverse and Web3. I am looking for names and if you come up with one, you'll get a free "citizenship".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to be involved - drop by my &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/p8yd0v"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; and join the channel #TheDao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ This week I took a break from reviewing &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5g8q"&gt;pitch decks&lt;/a&gt; and I started doing small videos answering questions that came from you. &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/xz62rn"&gt;Here is the first one&lt;/a&gt; (and one of my favorites). If you have any questions, reply to this email and I'll (probably) do a small video about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/4LvDNgWCUsEVbLmfkY036dRKIIH3H298WJIXx174HZjPyDCESc_rTw6oSsfEe3LTLa3_OXtvqm9pUd2uONqPtro9UFOIuf4knaYjyG9J1VNlN0cICmF0fGKai5F-lwD0T0fUxA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/ReCeXGgaIwqpjdk6uZrQXzAnJOJYXVTtrgG40szZ16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/xz62rn"&gt;Click here to see this epic video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ A couple weeks ago, I asked all of you to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/ll2rvp"&gt;help out with selling the domain house.new&lt;/a&gt;. I have three offers but they are a bit complicated. I'll wait a couple weeks before deciding. If you have a small Startup and you can use the domain, you can get it at a huge discount - just to irritate Zillow, &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5rwq"&gt;that is having a terrible week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ If you are &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/2y9pj6"&gt;watching my videos&lt;/a&gt;, you should know that I include hidden gems for those who are observant. In one of them I said at the end of the video "if you are watching this, I'll send you something interesting".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone that saw the hidden gem and reached out to me, you'll be getting a hardcopy of one of my favorite books "How To Live" that was released a couple months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/nLR9i8AdInH2TfNDo3HMHgThlurpYhQeWV3nHj5Z-G9d0WD7F9A_Uwh-mtXSUYy5kpSGZ_oJ80UPP2E6pWz1QAXMwllCs7pwXw0_CCRtBkKso8Nm0Z2PNfLH_XGj1CG48BoOng=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/keiFw86LVaSRoz4OskC4rTlwZ8UHCgBJhiblCKCk16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I like sending people physical items is that I like having a real connection. When you get a physical item - especially a book - you create conversations and bonds stronger than just words on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as you know, I always respond to anyone that sends me an email - that's why I am doing this newsletter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I talked about the Metaverse many times and I even had &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/qwpez6"&gt;my own Metaverse conference&lt;/a&gt; last summer but the space is getting crazy hot. Facebook (or should I say Meta?) will &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/k02oly"&gt;release haptic gloves&lt;/a&gt; so we can punch each other, China will &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/jq5req"&gt;integrate Metaverse with reality&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/gve242"&gt;Roblox&lt;/a&gt; (one of my favorite companies - disclosure: I am an investor) went up 30% in a day as more brands wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh and Nike is preparing &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/695yoe"&gt;a new Metaverse, NFTs and cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; benefit from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are experiencing one of the biggest wealth creation events in the human history. It's one of the few times where having deep knowledge of a subject and being able to provide/create value can change your life and the life of thousands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just "Web-3", it is "Internet-2"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start reading about DAOs, NFTs, how you can participate, how they work, how this new world operates and what are the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/580rn0rq/09qx6q"&gt;It is crazy right now but it is going to get crazier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I am reviving the "Algorithms Pay My Bills" Community on &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to drop by and chit-chat, you are more than welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;Metaverse Cities&lt;/a&gt;. What I haven't told you is that …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy these newsletters and think a colleague or a friend should read them, please get them to sign up on this page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Last time I talked about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities"&gt;Metaverse Cities&lt;/a&gt;. What I haven't told you is that I am a Citizen of the &lt;a href="https://www.citydao.io/"&gt;CityDAO&lt;/a&gt;. CityDAO has bought real land in Wyoming and a community of 6k+ citizens is planning to build a whole city. Seems that the Metaverse is clashing with reality pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I am excited about DAOs is that I am working on launching a new DAO about the Metaverse and Web3. If you want to be involved - drop by &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA"&gt;my Discord&lt;/a&gt; and join the channel #TheDao.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In my latest &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/e84rop"&gt;pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about what most investors look in a pitch deck. Hint: It is money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/RBMqw_0ljR2vHuK2hsfHmkOrLEfWsMAROV74XpCYKeFDZPTzyiLh581dp-0GyP22nPzh49N3t4NObPxFt8hr8MN5wjNhVZmQPPGMH6FbtLEQNQsisbLEeT8SR_CDbSTbjdKD-w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/6JqdpM2IKdGOqIXCkQDwmQYvpiCdyhdIgDICV3jP16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/e84rop"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I've invested in a lot of DAOs and "not traditional" companies but one of them will blow your mind with their business model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a crypto game called &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/84204r"&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, valued at $3 Billion and got funding from the biggest VCs on the planet. To participate in that game you need to buy their NFTs and then by playing you can earn money - this is called Play-to-Earn (P2E).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is mind blowing is that you can invest in a "company" that buys the NFTs and "rents" them out to players in countries like the Philippines. These players play all day long, win money and they "profit-share" with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you still haven't got it, you can have your own e-Sports team, running fully decentralized and autonomously, earning money while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/k0y7qj"&gt;Here is a video to see more about this story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Netflix is &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/p8ovgd"&gt;expanding to games&lt;/a&gt;. You will be able to buy and play games using your Netflix subscription. It seems that all companies at the moment became game companies and then add NFTs. I wonder if anyone is still building non-Entertainment products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many exciting things happened last week (I won't even discuss about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/vq6krd"&gt;Facebook changing their name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;) so let's jump right into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So many exciting things happened last week (I won't even discuss about &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/vq6krd"&gt;Facebook changing their name to Meta&lt;/a&gt;) so let's jump right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've been working towards building a "real" Metaverse. That means a city, with its &lt;strong&gt;own physical language&lt;/strong&gt;, currency and a DAO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Αλγοκρατία (Algocracy) is a type of Democracy where instead of Demos (the public) holding (crato/krato) the laws, we have algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the heart of the Metaverse and not 3d avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/k0kgdy"&gt;Click here to share it on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it seems that is the next steps as &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/742v6l"&gt;Metacities are started to get formed&lt;/a&gt;. What a crazy world we live in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in helping out, reply to this email and I'll keep you in the loop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/69wwze"&gt;In my latest pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about why you need a CTO and why you shouldn't scale prematurely. As my personal motto goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make it to fail, not to scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/LxyS5acjdrGtjvJmaHwBPvOXvPJiDmXftTE5S6cMxnjO7kAAgUfIFcQs7Wej8dFTVt7GbHYFHJBou9-zi8nIMngMNvmUDA6DUFVnWHDzLLZPBhJCts83LrHWKanqj0EIhynrYg=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/mafGqKDYXjqj6iDQoJc4Xn33SFM2QAClst5IcVDE16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/69wwze"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ The most common misconceptions for success are the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) You need to be smart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) You need to be rich&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) You need to be talented&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can guarantee you that if &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/op6649"&gt;someone like me&lt;/a&gt; can do it then everyone can. And I mean it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things that helped me in building insanely competitive companies, destroying competition, making crazy investments (sometimes with 300x return) or identifying new markets long before the majority (like Ethereum at $8) are these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) You should have no issue with failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to fail = Learn to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Destroy your ego if you want to make a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/xz0029"&gt;Share this on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) Learn how to become &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/qwnneg"&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;. It is impossible not to have your ass beaten so learn how to become like water - powerful but never rigid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Get better at storytelling. If you cannot inspire people, if you cannot make them dream, it doesn't make what you are building. Take lessons, start writing small stories even blog posts and get better at storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d) Commit. Do you want a perfect body? Commit to diet and exercise. Do you want to build wealth? Commit to hard work. Do you want love? Commit to improving yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple but not easy instructions ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I am planning to release the third version of &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/dpzz70"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;, the NFT Marketplace that I started by accident. But I am going to do this in public!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a movement called #buildinpublic where you build your product "in the open", for everyone to see. You share the good times and the bad times. And I like it because it helps more people to see that Startups are not overnight successes but hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an amazing infographic by &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/84xxl2"&gt;manceraio&lt;/a&gt; that can help you launch your Startup - if you want to try out the #buildinpublic movement ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://ci5.googleusercontent.com/proxy/oeBR5CoTr340IWYcogZ4RMk9RV84Crf1m4H_ur7zUFqD5Z3y_X5Tvx19Y6f1oMUbZGBV3w3DWhYcR2x7RjsYewB8kMTGKkIgG2fp391kG9Klly3Oy5PKbsiR4br1y0dlFCr11w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/bW8CwS6KhzdB2n6dGnLXZQZO3udV8gDtnc9oCBA716325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ There is a new kind of domain, the &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/xz00y9"&gt;".new"&lt;/a&gt;. These are called "the shortcuts of the web". For example, if you go to &lt;a href="https://sendfox.com/trk/click/9x5v9g0p/84xxl8"&gt;docs.new&lt;/a&gt;, a new Google Doc will be created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I bought the house.new domain because I think that companies (like Zillow) will love to have this domain. But instead of just selling it, I want to try an experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can find a buyer for house.new, you get 20% of the final price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's that simple. You find a buyer (let's say $10k), the buyer gets it and you get $2k (or whatever it is after fees). The highest price by next Thursday, gets the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And this is where things become interesting&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead of me spending these money on surfboards, I will place the money in a DAO that will hire people (maybe you?) to do more tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is that this DAO, becomes self-sustained, grows its capital thus making everyone a shareholder, decision-maker, employee and employer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some cool comments were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) Never say that you are better than a competitor - companies have already done their due diligence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) B2B Software selling, it's 70% side-by-side solution architecture, 20% empathising, and 10% team character. If you reached into the point of the funnel that you have a call/meting, you don't have to "sell".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c) Don't freeze or stutter on the cost question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more comments &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_one-thing-i-learnt-as-an-entrepreneur-trying-activity-6859087531116494848-kxz7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and if we are not connected on Linkedin, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnvlachoyiannis/"&gt;we should&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let jump to the top five things that happened last 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Today Facebook will be announcing its Metaverse plans. But wait wait wait. If you haven't seen &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2021/10/27/watch-facebooks-metaverse-musical-about-open-enrollment-for-benefits.html"&gt;Facebook's official metaverse musical about employees&lt;/a&gt; you are missing out. It is sooo cringeworthy and internet is going nuts about the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ In my &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vS3EXCXkZnY"&gt;latest pitch deck review&lt;/a&gt;, I talk about academics trying to build products and Startups. The video has already created very heated discussions as my point of view is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;building stuff &amp;gt; talking about stuff&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video I talk about why it might hurt your chances raising money if you have taken money for your Startup from a government (or the European union) or why it might be negative if you have any scientific papers about your product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/dFT40SmMpqjZja8nWnRyYh86PIjWTQFJo3jp88Im16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vS3EXCXkZnY"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Having said that, Ryan Petersen put the glasses on every single Operations researcher/scientist in LA and universities got offended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The port of LA/Long Beach is at a standstill. That means shipments are not making their way around California, the US and even the whole world. It is a gridlock, an operational mayhem. What Ryan did? &lt;strong&gt;He rented a boat and inspected the operations as close as he could&lt;/strong&gt;. He identified the easiest thing to fix that would solve 90% of the issue and posted his solution on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When you're designing an operation you must choose your bottleneck. If the bottleneck appears somewhere that you didn't choose it, you aren't running an operation. It's running you."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then people start improving on the idea and shared it with the Mayor of Long Beach, Robert Garcia. &lt;strong&gt;And OMG, it was actually implemented! AND IT WORKS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/DaXp7SlpYFsC4Iqjji5IoqOzvt6Sv8j4UKKixp3D16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ A crypto collective - a DAO - bought from the Department of Justice &lt;a href="https://pleasr.mirror.xyz/PTzSIYe6LbNW55i_Jo4S_fgqIiDp3d7YblpikQ1iRks"&gt;Wu-Tang Clan’s unreleased album&lt;/a&gt;, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin for &lt;strong&gt;$4M&lt;/strong&gt;. Let me break it down for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wu-Tang Clan's unreleased album was bought by a hedge fund manager that went to jail for fraud for seven years. Department of Justice got custody of the album. And this is where things become interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/XUTAIVjPcKB0xoV8mwcm9ppXcrLPbKs7EvyJOnO316325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of people have formed a DAO to buy collectible NFTs. The name of the DAO is &lt;a href="https://pleasr.org/"&gt;PleasrDAO&lt;/a&gt; and they have bought some very interesting NFTs in the past. Long story short, they went to DOJ and said that we want to buy that album for $4M and ... boom! &lt;strong&gt;They are now the only people on the planet that have heard this album and have the rights&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ The first trillion is always the hardest. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/20/spacex-could-make-elon-musk-world-first-trillionaire-says-morgan-stanley"&gt;Elon Musk is on his way to become the first trillionaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember all these financial analysts claiming that the internet is a fad, a bubble? How many huge enterprises shutdown for being to stiff to "go with the wave", how many people missed out on a big "wealth transfer event"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is happening again with the Metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can scream and shout that crypto and NFTs are a scam but reality doesn't care about anyone's opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/J1JVxJiGSJb9M733MiPsBKVyDLbE3HoktOB01lfr16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things you need to know about the "new reality":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;Facebook will be changing its name&lt;/a&gt; and will hire more than 10000 people to build the Metaverse (or at least Facebook's version of Metaverse).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all building their Metaverse trying to capture as much of the &lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/"&gt;"Web3"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I wrote an article about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/five-reasons-why-you-cannot-sell-your-nfts"&gt;why you cannot sell your NFTs&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't know how to make your NFTs, this is another article &lt;a href="https://jon.io/create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;how to do it for free&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't know what an NFT is, &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;here is a small intro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/MrD4oUk9LSWvj4oiYzWXKfFMGHaoWaNYfo5IebHH16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of the work, the future of companies and the heart of a Metaverse is a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/?sh=7b3a8bd7305f"&gt;DAO&lt;/a&gt;. A DAO is a bunch of algorithms that define the operations/rules of a company/team/country and people are responsible for the governance (by voting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a DAO can have 1000 members where all have chipped in to buy self-driving cars. These self-driving cars will be rented out, recharge on their own and the profits will go back to the DAO. A DAO can also hire people and pay them as a normal company. The difference is that all decisions are made by anonymous, fully remote citizens and are enforced by algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href="https://flamingodao.xyz/"&gt;FlamingoDAO&lt;/a&gt; buys and sells NFTs. 1hive hires people to build projects that make more money for the DAO. &lt;a href="https://www.olympusdao.finance/"&gt;OlympusDAO&lt;/a&gt; builds fully financial products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DAO doesn't need an HR department. You pick up any task you want, you complete it, it gets reviewed and you get your money. There are a lot of people working on one or multiple DAOs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ Ok, let's take a breather because this was A LOT of information. One thing I learnt as an Entrepreneur trying to sell products to big customers is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/want-to-make-consumers-dissatisfied-with-a-product-tell-them-a-better-version-is-coming-11634752462"&gt;NEVER say that a new version&lt;/a&gt; or a new feature is coming out soon. You give them a "way out" to postpone their decision. You cannot come back from someone saying "oh, that's exciting! let's talk back when this feature is out".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I recorded another &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/nUlE3gDqrvQ"&gt;Pitch Deck review&lt;/a&gt; and people are already interested in investing in this company. Check it out - a very good pitch deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/GvX6Jiemel8mTnvsaOYxN6f3YuTVE8fZ9CIbaEpI16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, I sold more than 100 NFTs, sometimes for celebrities, other times for smaller creators or for &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-organized-my-own-conference-like-gary-vee-in-30-days"&gt;my own conference&lt;/a&gt; (which sold out three times).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked with …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Five months ago, I decided to sell my first NFT, &lt;a href="my-birthday-cake-as-an-nft"&gt;a piece of cake for my birthday&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/"&gt;my NFT platform&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I talked with every big Hollywood talent agency and I saw them selling less than my birthday cake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/nft-post-sale.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the reasons why they (and you) fail to sell your NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You think the platform matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you go to Amazon, do you go and browse their homepage to find what is new or are you searching for something specific?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is exactly&lt;/strong&gt; how people buy NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't go to OpenSea and say "oh this little monkey from a creator I never heard of before is on sale for 10 Ether, I need to buy this right now". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;99% of NFT sales happen by sending people &lt;strong&gt;directly&lt;/strong&gt; to the NFT page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have higher chances of selling NFTs &lt;strong&gt;outside&lt;/strong&gt; of OpenSea/Rarible/etc as your buyers won't get distracted by random NFTs. 
See all projects that make &lt;strong&gt;consistent&lt;/strong&gt; sales. CryptoPunks, &lt;a href="i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;Hashmasks&lt;/a&gt;, Mekaverse - all of the big NFT projects have custom pages for their drops. Of course, if you want to resell you need to end up on OpenSea but don't be delusional thinking that anyone could find your NFT in this (well) sea of NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you would have known that but ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You haven't bought any NFTs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to buy NFTs to understand how to sell NFTs. I met artists with millions of followers that wanted to sell NFTs and didn't have a Metamask wallet. Guess how many NFTs they sold? &lt;strong&gt;Less than my birthday cake&lt;/strong&gt; - and usually &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single NFT I bought was because someone from my community recommended that I should check it out. And all NFTs that made me money where bought outside of OpenSea (ok, I made some Ether by &lt;a href="i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;trading on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, trying to sell NFTs without ever buying one is like trying to be a soccer coach without knowing soccer (Ted Lasso is the exception. Also he is a fictional character). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying go and spend all your money buying random NFTs. But you need to get involved in projects and communities, see how things work and understand how and why people make money and why you end up having only 4 views of your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest example is influencers trying to sell to their followers and end up making only "pocket money" because their followers have NO idea how to setup a wallet or what Ether is. I guarantee you the biggest talent agencies with their infinite connections and budgets have ZERO idea how to make any NFT sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having more followers or being famous means shit in the Metaverse&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the next reason on why no one buys your stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You have no Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are following me on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, you know by now that I am a true Metallica fan. I am the person who drove 4 hours to go and watch Metallica perform in a Drive-in. I am a &lt;strong&gt;true fan&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community is the biggest asset any creator or company has. It cannot be copied. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followers are not Believers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The random integers you see on your social profiles that represent how many "followers" you have are just a vanity metric. How many of them are actually going to &lt;strong&gt;travel&lt;/strong&gt; to see you? How many share your values?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sell NFTs (and sell consistently) you need people to share your values. An excellent example is &lt;a href="https://www.supernfty.com/"&gt;SuperNfty&lt;/a&gt;, an amazing creator that has a very active community. You should try and copy something that is true and sustainable. No one became Metallica in a day (or Justin Bieber if that's your thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll do another post about how to build and maintain your community because there is so much stuff and tools to cover in just one post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's move to my favorite reason:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the creators I met, have no idea how much they should price their first NFTs at. They go from 100 Ether (seriously) to zero and end up not 
making any sales. These creators are usually the same people that call NFTs a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want me to tell you the price of your NFT? I don't even need to see it. It is zero. Yes, zero Ether. You put the work to create something but you haven't put the work to &lt;strong&gt;honor your community&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead you are trying to rip them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want people to buy your stuff, you need make sure that your NFTs are 10x more valuable than you price them. If your NFTs have no value (because no one knows who you are or your vision) then you are doing a disservice to your believers (you see? - I didn't say followers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If people can't make money by buying and selling your NFTs you will never survive in this space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to sell on a different chain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you made zero sales on the Ethereum blockchain, you decided to go to Solana. Slow clap. I admire your Entrepreneurial spirit but no. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build value, serve your belivers. Stop saying bullshit to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because I might have been too harsh on you already, here are two extra reasons: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You are a famous "traditional" artist so you should make an NFT of your art&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Just no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You are a photographer and have an interesting photo to sell.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I learnt so many new cool stuff that I don't think one email can do justice. But I'll try. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I am having a blast with my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;"Startup Office Hours" channel&lt;/a&gt;. This week …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to another crazy Friday (or Saturday depending on your time zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I learnt so many new cool stuff that I don't think one email can do justice. But I'll try. Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I am having a blast with my &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;"Startup Office Hours" channel&lt;/a&gt;. This week I reviewed another pitch deck (link here) and I believe my editing skills have improved tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I started doing these videos are to help as many Entrepreneurs as I can but also to learn a new skill: &lt;strong&gt;Visual Storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;. If you have any feedback (seriously &lt;em&gt;ANY&lt;/em&gt; feedback helps) on things that can be improved just reply to this email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/J7Eis1MdJok4slky2IC43Y9acwK9xq1KjiO82Zaj16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qvf5eaLzFys"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I have been included in the &lt;strong&gt;100 Greek Innovators&lt;/strong&gt;. The article is in Greek but in short it says "Jon you are awesome".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/M50ODu7A5v6iHcq7iesdUCZBJOby93sKFwF6PFdY16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this was five years ago, I wouldn't stop talking about it. Currently the only person that tracks all these is my mother (and sometimes puts them into frames).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not that I consider myself a "big deal" but these don't give me an endorphin hit anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot of time I found what gives me that hit: &lt;strong&gt;building stuff&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day that I build something (could be a site, a video, even a post), I feel great. Strange feeling and I have no idea why this is happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago &lt;a href="https://jon.io/maximize-what-you-love-minimize-what-you-hate"&gt;I wrote a post about it&lt;/a&gt; so maybe it can help you find your endorphin highs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I cannot send an email and not include NFTs. Seriously, if you have no idea what NFTs, DAO and Blockchain mean, drop everything you do and start reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a post about NFTs and &lt;a href="https://jon.io/how-nfts-will-change-events-and-why-mark-cuban-is-a-genius"&gt;why Mark Cuban is a genius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ The Squid game. There are going to be &lt;strong&gt;zero spoilers&lt;/strong&gt; so you are good if you haven't watched it yet (but do, it is awesome).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/qgOfqtoFAQRismmq3qouvRrIUaDnMNpoC9eL7ZH216325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Squid game is the top show in 40 countries - and on its way to be Netflix's biggest show. It made an insane amount of money. But the script was &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/squid-game-script-was-rejected-for-10-years"&gt;rejected 10 years ago&lt;/a&gt; in its local market (Korea). What do we learn from this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commitment. If you believe on something, go for it. Life is not for playing it safe but for making a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big contributors of course are timing and location. This show might have been "too brutal" 10 years ago but now it is on "family airtime". And Netflix saw that the US will love a show like this and then the rest of the world will follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ I am surprised that most people are still working 9-5 without at least knowing about the &lt;a href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/"&gt;"ladder of wealth"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/EMWwFmrh1KyOmyH07t54e7Xb7bVtUKfcffyGk2q816325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this &lt;a href="https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/"&gt;excellent post&lt;/a&gt;, Barry talks about how you should progress from selling your time to selling products. This is a MUST READ even if you never plan to be an Entrepreneur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

I am almost back to &lt;a href="https://jon.io/scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger"&gt;scheduling meetings like Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. And that's a cool thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your inbox is not a todo list that everyone on the planet can add tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to make an impact, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; need to prioritize. Emphasis on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;*you&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that sprinkle of wisdom (damn, that's a cool name for a song), here are the 5 epic things I learnt this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, reply to this email and tell me your epic thing you learnt this week and I'll include it in the next email. How cool is that! Here we go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Another &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sfFOumJZo"&gt;Pitch Deck review&lt;/a&gt; is out and this time is about an eCommerce Startup. Excellent flow and solid progress. Check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/X05amsQKelXqw20gsn9bjHvOKnd7oQwF6YJiAg0B16325"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3sfFOumJZo"&gt;Click here to see this epic video!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ I think I figured out how to go viral on Instagram and it is annoying. Oh, it is very annoying. With a 7 second video, I got 42k likes (and still going up) and 400k views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how I did it (I plan to run a couple more experiments so &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;follow me on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; if you want to be annoyed by the experiments):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) The most important thing is to include music in your post. Trending music. Instagram and Tik Tok prioritize posts with popular music&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) No more photos. Videos. Short videos. Up to 10 - 15 seconds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. Experiment and play around. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT-CLhKpLXM/"&gt;post is here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I talked with a new Entrepreneur last week and she told me that she is terrified about how people will perceive her work. And by people I don't only mean customers but also friends and family. I told her what I tell to everyone in my &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;free Startup course&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fail fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media amplified the success stories and all of a sudden everyone thinks that you can hit all the shots you take and if you don't, there is something wrong with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have something important to tell you and it is not that a lot of people fail. It is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody. Cares.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The faster you realize this, the faster your life will improve and you can focus on things that &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ I keep getting so many questions about NFTs and whether are gambling or not. Here is an article about how an &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nft-evolved-apes-scam/"&gt;NFT creator run off with almost $3M&lt;/a&gt;. And it is not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New technologies create new opportunities to make money fast and lose money faster. That doesn't mean that you should be blind. You should read as much as you can about this new exciting world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an article I wrote about &lt;a href="https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks"&gt;trading NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Now that &lt;a href="https://www.gq.com/story/seinfeld-netflix-episodes-cropped-widescreen-ratio"&gt;Seinfeld is on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, it's a good time to watch this video on how &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itWxXyCfW5s"&gt;Jerry Seinfeld writes a joke&lt;/a&gt; and the-now-famous &lt;a href="https://nickwignall.com/seinfeld-strategy/"&gt;method of kicking ass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

It was crazy how much difference a single person can make. The biggest misconception is that we cannot make a change. I am here to tell you, that you - yes, YOU - can create and shape the world if you put your mind into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA (the Machine Learning Platform that analyzed thousands of tourists), just made it into Nature. Yes, the biggest scientific magazine in the world. Which is crazy! Hopefully this work will inspire more people to build cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ I started training how I breathe - because how &lt;a href="https://jon.io/you-are-breathing-wrong"&gt;we are breathing is wrong&lt;/a&gt;. I plan to post some more articles about biohacking and how you can improve your performance and reduce your stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, right to the chase (in Greece we say "right to the cooked meat").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ I've started &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn2w-ZYozDU"&gt;"Office Hours"&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube, where I review Startups &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. So if you want to learn from others or you have an idea to review, check the detailed post right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/youtube/fintechstartup.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ The first &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT5fBcYPw9T/"&gt;NFT fashion line&lt;/a&gt; will go live pretty soon. If you have any idea about fashion (or lines :D), I would love to pick your brain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ I read in one sitting Derek's new book &lt;a href="https://sive.rs/h"&gt;"How to Live"&lt;/a&gt;. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is a small but condensed book of knowledge and you'll keep re-reading it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-weekly-mailchimp-uber-ron-klain-9-2021"&gt;Mailchimp got acquired for $12 Billion&lt;/a&gt; and the employees got Zero (with a capital Z). The founders walked away with $5 Billion each. Remember: getting a salary gets you through the day, getting equity gets you through a life (I don't even know if that makes sense, I just came up with it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ SEC moves aggressively towards crypto by forcing Coinbase to drop their &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/"&gt;lending product&lt;/a&gt;. The real question is whether the US (and subsequently the whole world) will embrace crypto or outlaw it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for today. See you next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day I get around 100 emails from Entrepreneurs asking for my feedback/help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I love it, it goes against my two rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do undistracted deep work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Impact as many people as I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's why I decided to streamline the process and start "The Startup Office Hours".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reviews in the open&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every week, I'll pick one Startup that has &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/ARhTF4DydhqGizuK6"&gt;submitted an entry&lt;/a&gt; and I'll do a video review of their pitch deck and/or website. For free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I'll have a chat with the team and sometimes I'll bring some subject matters experts, angels and VCs to provide some feedback.
That way, I can impact as many people as I can (instead of repeating the same stuff to every Startup) and for the founders, well, 
my network consists mostly of Angel Investors, VCs and Entrepreneurs that can help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/youtube/ai-startup.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and check the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdAC0o1hmy9JkYcph0GVrog"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. Oh, I am planning to post highlights on my Instagram account, so feel free to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;follow me there too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are an Entrepreneur that wants a review, &lt;a href="https://forms.gle/ARhTF4DydhqGizuK6"&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please share this to anyone that might benefit from this and let's make this a valuable library for Startups.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>I organized my own conference like Gary Vee in 30 days</title><link href="http://jon.io/i-organized-my-own-conference-like-gary-vee-in-30-days" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-07-27T22:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

It didn't have thousands of attendees (because there is a thing called &lt;a href="how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;) but it had &lt;a href="how-nfts-will-change-events-and-why-mark-cuban-is-a-genius"&gt;NFTs as tickets&lt;/a&gt;, tons of sponsors and happened in the best place you can be for the summer - Greece. If you don't believe me ask &lt;a href="https://greekreporter.com/2021/07/04/jeff-bezos-vacation-greece/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/06/28/justin-bieber-and-his-wife-hailey-getaway-to-greece-mykonos/"&gt;Justin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/metaverse_selfie.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the story how (and why) this conference started right &lt;a href="https://jon.io/organizing-a-crypto-conference-in-europe-in-less-than-a-month"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider this as a guide on how to do your own conference or a huge meetup. And maybe bug &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/garyvee"&gt;Gary&lt;/a&gt; to use this brand new &lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;NFT-as-tickets&lt;/a&gt; technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free also to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTU5MDE1MTM4NDYwNjk2?story_media_id=2597301977270937775_35696786"&gt;check some highlights&lt;/a&gt; on my Instagram. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Took me 1 month to organize it and execute it (while I was vacationing in Greece)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the same effect as in weddings. If you have one year, it will take you one year of planning. If you have 1 week, it will take you one week of planning. Not relevant but my wedding took me 1 week from planning to execution. Some people call this (the effect, not my wedding) the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"&gt;Parkinson's Law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you either need to cut corners &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; have an epic team helping you out. I am blessed that I had an amazing community helping out, making intros to sponsors, even helping with coordination and finding us space. I love you all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/people.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Don't over-thinking it and don't over-engineer it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Use NFTs as tickets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built my own NFT ticketing system and used it, front-running Gary here (sorry Gary).
If you want to learn more about the technology and how to create your own NFT tickets (it is trivial and free!), check this post (&lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;create your own NFT tickets for free in less than 1 minute&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For "V as in MetaVerse" I wanted people to experience "The Metaverse" and it was important for me to have everyone buy NFTs and use a cryptowallet. If we used "normal" tickets it would be lame (Bitcoin 2021 in Miami - I am looking at you). So I did the thing I know really well: destroying my vacations by writing smart contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos from the conference (we had a professional team from LA flying to Athens to document everything - thank you &lt;a href="http://www.northandtouth.com/"&gt;N&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;) are going to be available to people that attended the event and own the NFT. How awesome is that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/clicknft.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Practice what you preach. A crypto conference without using crypto is hilariously lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More than 3200 subscribers in 2 weeks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to build a community? Be yourself and have fun. 
I was posting content &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/"&gt;non-stop&lt;/a&gt; and I was even posting videos while I was on vacations about how the conference was progressing. Of course we had tons of media sponsors and TV/Radio channels that kept pushing on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/haha.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Be helpful, add value and keep pushing. Don't bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19 strict restrictions (everyone must be tested or provide tests)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most challenging part. Checking tests, wearing masks and not being able to have more than 50 people in one space. We could have done the conference in an open space but screen glaring and no WiFi was a no-go. Other than that, once you were inside the space (and your &lt;a href="create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute"&gt;NFT ticket was scanned and verified&lt;/a&gt;), you were safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/working.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Minimize red-tape and restrictions and if necessary, add them in the beginning of the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do more of fun stuff - less of boring stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podiums and slides are terrible. Please stop doing this. We copied the format from my podcast &lt;a href="https://www.wearesiliconbeach.com/"&gt;Silicon Beach&lt;/a&gt; and all the presentations were fireside chats (or as I like to call them "firechats"). &lt;strong&gt;EVERYONE&lt;/strong&gt; loved them and most of the audience stayed for 6 hours listening to the speakers. On a Saturday. In Greece. During the summer. Yes, it was &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to talk with world class speakers is more interesting, engaging and the audience enjoys it way more. Do more of fun stuff, less of boring stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/risa.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take away: Run &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; favorite conference. Feel free to do stuff differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I got epic speakers flying in from the biggest companies on the planet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People flew from LA, NY, Monaco, London just to participate in my conference. I am forever grateful to them because this was a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/eva.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We gave 2500 euros (~$3000) to participants of the hackathon (yes, we even had a hackathon)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the teams never wrote a smart contract before. But they did their first transaction on the blockchain and figured out how authentication works, how off chain solutions might be faster but have issues, what are these "gas fees" etc. Some teams came by train (6 hours) from Thessaloniki and kicked ass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.freaking.loved.it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/maria.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don't overthink it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My motto &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;built to fail&lt;/a&gt; has never failed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/palikari.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Start small&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn't the first time I was organizing an event. I have organized hundreds of events in San Francisco, Europe even in Japan and I was even the organizer of a Google User Technology Group (GTUG) so I had a good idea of how to run an event. Of course going from organizing small meetups to organizing a conference under &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; own brand was a huge leap of faith but you'll never know unless you try :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaverse2021/mitsos.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Was it easy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh no. Not easy AT ALL. I was crazy stressed and during the conference I skipped eating because I was the host of the firechats. But we had so many speakers and not a lot of time and I had to squeeze everyone in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was very gratifying. Most people from the conference went for food afterwards and I had the clarify of fasting &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; being around friends and intelligent people in my favorite place in the world. Awesome feeling.
But the 29 days before that were not fun :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things that didn't work out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had 14 more sponsors that wanted to participate (and they have already signed up for next years' conference!) but I didn't have time to on-board them, collect payments and get their images and websites. I know it sounds easy but I had tons of other things that HAD to happen and I couldn't outsource this. So, one thing I should do is make the process of onboarding automated or at least easier to be done by someone else than me. Definitely a "fail" moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swag. Our swag provider didn't deliver on time. So we had no swag for the conference. Buuuuuut I am going to send swag to everyone that got a ticket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration. It should have been a 3-day conference. 7 hours firechats are brutal. In my defence, I never thought we'll have all these amazing speakers flying to the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food. Damn you COVID! We were not allowed to bring food to the conference so in my "built-to-fail" fashion, I started going to "private lunches" with each team separately. Money was not an issue (thank you again sponsors!) but having to eat 5 times in &lt;em&gt;Day One&lt;/em&gt; and 0 in &lt;em&gt;Day Two&lt;/em&gt; was not balanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you made it this far, thank you and I would love to hear what you think. Send me a message on &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt; (or an email) - I always respond to all emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided for my annual conference &lt;a href="https://jon.io/metaverse2021"&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/a&gt; to use NFTs as tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial I will cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metaimg.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can create as many NFT tickets as your want &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt;. The NFT tickets are 100% NFTs (ERC721), stored in IPFS and are available automatically on OpenSea after someone buys them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you won't need any special software to "check-in" people - just a phone camera.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can charge and get paid in Ether for your event just by entering your wallet address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can create a &lt;strong&gt;mailing list&lt;/strong&gt; of everyone who bought your NFT ticket (and make support super easy).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you won't learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to change the image of the NFT (and text) after someone checked-in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to airdrop NFT gifts to your buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to use the API to create a service to sell tickets.
I'll cover all of this in the next tutorial - so don't forget to subscribe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn about the first Metaverse conference that used this technology - you can read &lt;a href=""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I create NFT tickets?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating NFT tickets is as easy as creating simple NFTs. It is just one checkbox. One click. Right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/clicknft.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's go into detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating an NFT on &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com"&gt;OMGDrops.com&lt;/a&gt; assumes that you have an approved creator's account. If you don't, drop by the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX"&gt;discord&lt;/a&gt; and I'll create one for you. Sorry we are a small team and we are trying not to drown in support requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, you don't need ANY money to create NFTs. No need for Ether either. You can have a zero balance crypto wallet. No need to pay for proxies (I am looking at you, OpenSea) or to mint an NFT (I am looking at you, Rarible). Your buyers can buy your NFTs in pure Ether (no need to convert to WETH, DAI or whatever) and at the lowest gas fees out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/buy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's see how really easy it is to create an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/upload_nft_high.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You upload your image/gif/movie whatever, write a small description and then you click &lt;strong&gt;unlockable content&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;NFT ticket&lt;/strong&gt;. You press "Done" and well ... you are done! Everyone can buy your sparkling, awesome, majestic NFT for your brilliant event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens after someone buys the NFT ticket?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone buys your NFT ticket, it becomes immediatelly available on OpenSea for trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/opensea.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means the buyer can put it on auction, fixed price or do whatever else they want. Oh, and you always get to keep 10% of the resale price ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can also "unlock it" by clicking "unlock content" and putting their email - they will get a QR code. This QR can be used to check in at the event but more importantly it can be saved as an image, so the buyer won't need internet access at check-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/unlock.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People at the check-in door have a couple of choices to scan the tickets. The easiest is with a phone camera. They will be redirected to a page that says whether the ticket is &lt;strong&gt;valid&lt;/strong&gt;, has been &lt;strong&gt;resold&lt;/strong&gt; or has been &lt;strong&gt;redeemed&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next choice (which is my favorite) is using the scanner from a cryptowallet. In that case, the door scanner can "check in" the user (so noone else can use the ticket). The scanner or the issuer can also change any metadata including the NFT image - we call these dynamic NFTs. I will cover this in the next blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/metacheck.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, all NFTs with unlockable content require email address of the buyer, so you can integrate this with your CRM (still unsure whether we are going to keep this feature).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's recap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You created your tickets &lt;strong&gt;for free&lt;/strong&gt; in 5 seconds and they are even &lt;a href="/images/ipfs.gif"&gt;automatically stored on IPFS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You checked in everyone securely without going crazy and without any special software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have their wallet addresses in case you want to airdrop them any free NFTs (as a thank you).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You created a mailing list with your NFT buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to play around and break the system - feel free to jump to our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX"&gt;Discord&lt;/a&gt;. I will be more than happy to see this solution used for all real crypto events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: We also have an API if you are interested in building your own first NFT ticketing platform!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Cathrine for being such a good friend and getting me a courtside seat ticket that costs &lt;strong&gt;a fortune&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="images/ticket-red.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your alternative is to try to sell it (and maybe less than she got it for) and try not to get scammed (or knifed) while selling it. So much stress for having good friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter NFT Tickets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But fortunately your ticket was actually an NFT ticket. That means that you can sell it on one of the existing platforms pretty easily and probably &lt;strong&gt;at a higher&lt;/strong&gt; price. If everything goes as planned, you should be able to sell it under a minute or even put it up for an auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Cathrine is devastated that you want to sell her gift (and make a profit off of it). So you decide to go to the event.
And it is actually pretty fun! The check-in is like a normal ticket with a QR code but what is epic is that the DallasM  has "airdropped" (lingo for sending you for free) a new NFT that unlocks a hoodie. BOOM! Oh and now you have access to the highlights of the show! And you can sell your &lt;strong&gt;collectible&lt;/strong&gt; ticket after the event!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This.is.awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why NFT tickets are the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one utility to NFTs, it the ability to resale your tickets without having to jump through hoops or pay crazy fees. And I know this could be a heaven for scalpers (and hell for everyone else) but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I buy my ticket &lt;strong&gt;with Ether&lt;/strong&gt; for Dallas Maverics vs LA Lakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can resell the ticket if I want to and the team gets a cut from resales - because that's how NFTs work (and blacklist scalpers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I check-in with my ticket without any complicated apps &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can get more NFTs as airdrops if Dallas win (and I can keep them as memorabilia or sell them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My NFT ticket can also change after the game - for example to reflect the score (see later on: dynamic NFTs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why NFT tickets are NOT the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets &lt;strong&gt;must be bought and sold&lt;/strong&gt; with Ether and that means some initial friction. I've seen tons of new NFT platforms and NFT ticketing solutions that are destined to crash and burn because they plan to sell NFTs with fiat ($ or euro). Why fiat sucks? Because if you really want to participate in selling your NFTs, stacking them up, unlocking content and doing all these crazy stuff in the Metaverse &lt;strong&gt;you need to be on the blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;. If I am just an entry in your database and I am not really the owner of my NFT &lt;strong&gt;why are we doing  this&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, after the initial friction of setting up a metamask wallet, users that bought my &lt;a href="i-organized-my-own-conference-like-gary-vee-in-30-days"&gt;NFT tickets for my conference&lt;/a&gt; were able to immediately resell them in a HUGE market (OpenSea) or use them to unlock videos from the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being "on the chain" is hands down the best long term experience. Unless you don't want people to resale your NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's it. That's the only thing. I used NFT tickets for my conference and almost 1000 new wallets were created by people who haven't heard about NFTs before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not rocket science and this is how you grow your community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathwork is breathing with intention in order to provoke physical or mental changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out very fast that the majority of people have no idea what a superpower breathing can be.
And of course that we are breathing fundamentally wrong (hint: you should breathe &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can breathing make you stressed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know to "take a deep breath to relax" or to "take a deep breath, this is going to hurt" and we assumed that breathing more air makes things &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. Newsflash: It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever had a panic attack (or seen a movie where someone was super stressed), you might know about the paper bag trick. The trick is that when you are stressed, breathe in and out inside a small paper bag. How this works is that you are breathing CO2 instead of oxygen. When we are stressed, &lt;strong&gt;we breathe&lt;/strong&gt; more oxygen (and we hyperventilate) and our CO2 blood levels go down. And this is bad. Surprisingly, our brain freaks out A TON when CO2 levels are low. Our brain also freaks out when CO2 levels are high (lack of oxygen) but this is something that we can learn to control (up to a level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I need high CO2 in my blood? CO2 is bad!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO2 and oxygen are in a balance in your bloodstream. This balance is disrupted when you are inhaling tons of oxygen. Of course there are cases where this disruption leads to an improved system and we'll get there. But messing up with the balance without intention is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first symptoms is starting to feel light headed, jittery and panicky. In order to increase your CO2, there are a couple of ways. One is to breathe more CO2 from a paper bag (inhale and exhale in the paper bag). The other is to &lt;strong&gt;stop breathing&lt;/strong&gt;. And before you start passing out from holding your breath, let me explain how we should increase our CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is CO2 good for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is awesome. If you hold your breath right now, you will last (before gasping for air) 1 or 2 minutes (the world record is around 24 minutes). For me, that is a very strange fact. Why the most important thing for our survival is not stored? Why I store fat the moment I eat some chocolate but I cannot store oxygen? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is being used to create energy by providing the "fire" to "burn" nutrients . Storing tons of "fire" can be 
problematic as fire has a tendancy to spread. Uncontrollably. 
The conversion to energy is happening in the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. These little guys are responsible for producing the energy that we need (if you want to get technical, they produce ATP) and they are using oxygen in the process. At another post we'll talk about why you should be taking CoQ10 as a supplement to increase your ATP production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you pump your system with too much oxygen all day long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firestarter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/firestarter.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By overusing your mitochondria, you start creating inflamation in your body (you create free radicals). Inflamation can be good if it is controlled (like when you go to gym, you pump iron and then your muscles recover and you get stronger) but if it happens all the time is bad. Very bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, your mitochondria are not working very efficiently. They create energy that is not used as it supposed to.
This has been linked to a lot of illnesses like diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's just to name a few. Your mitochondria need to be trained. And the way to train them is by restricting their oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting high on your own supply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was training for my pilots' license, I was told about hypoxia - the phenomenon of not having enough oxygen. 
It happens when you are over 20000 feet and you can check &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_MI9UiYwJA"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to see that it is hilarious (when you are on the ground). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is deadly when you are flying a plane because you feel ephoric as your brain start hallucinating and you have
no idea that you are in danger. You are just very very happy (happy hormones such as serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, noradrenaline are released when CO2 levels are high). And this happens because there is lack of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soooo, now oxygen is good?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you increase for &lt;strong&gt;a bit&lt;/strong&gt; your CO2 levels, you are putting your body under stress. 
Like going to the gym and you exercise. When the exercise is over the balance is restored, your body has improved. Your mitochondria are operating a bit more efficiently, the inflammation has gone down and the temporary inflamation created has actually attacked any possible intruders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By increasing &lt;strong&gt;mindfully&lt;/strong&gt; your oxygen levels, you make your blood alkaline (you increase it's pH) and my increasing your CO2 levels, you make it acidic. This switch, makes your autonomous nervous system to rebalance and leads to reduced stress, reduced anxiety and increased performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing your CO2 levels (as we said you can learn to increase the threshold with practice), you can increase your athletic performance. This is due to the fact that you increase production of ATP. An example is by using the Wim Hof breathing, you can perform a lot more push ups than you are able to do, all &lt;strong&gt;while holding your breath&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Damn this is interesting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not even the beginning! Wait until we talk about what happens when you dive in cold water and stay there for a long time and your prehistoric brain turns on and starts protecting you. Or how by not breathing you can have increased physical performance. Or how you can convert fat to "brown fat" that is used faster for energy. Or why breathing through your mouth can mess up your HRV (heart rate variability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next posts, we'll cover topics like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to unblock your nose in 1 minute by alternating your breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to hold your breath for 2 minutes with less than 1 minute practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can improve your immune system with breathing exercises (and tons of scientific research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Six different breathworks for relaxation (Wim Hof, Holotropic, Buteyko etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why breathing from your mouth changes the structure of your whole face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And tons of more cool factoids&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to formalize this by doing a yearly &lt;em&gt;"Jon V"&lt;/em&gt; conference where I meet my favorite, super smart Entrepreneurs and do a deep dive into technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing how the US is a bit "ahead" in terms of technology and blockchain adoption, I decided to run a &lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; conference and talk about NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs and Startups from inception, to development to productization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about the agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan was simple: Get a huge airbnb, invite some people that want to learn and let's have a hackathon. But I think we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; will take place sometime in the beginning of July in Greece. Maybe Athens? Maybe Kalamata? Maybe somewhere else? It all depends on the location I can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tickets for the event will be &lt;strong&gt;NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;. A limited edition of NFTs will be given for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to volunteers, speakers and people that don't have the financial means to attend. The rest of the tickets/NFTs will be available at various prices ($10-$50). The reason there is a price, is because I want to weed out people that are not committed in coming and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will be three days. Day one, is presentations and workshops about blockchain development, NFTs, branding, fund raising, Startups and anything else we can fit in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day two, is the hackathon and some networking events. You have 24 hours to build a kick ass blockchain project based on a theme to be announced. The first three teams will get a price from our sponsors.
 
Day three, in the morning, we select the winners and that's a wrap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of course will be available online a couple of weeks after the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is that it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha, of course not! There is a surprise in all this. A &lt;strong&gt;hidden&lt;/strong&gt; project that hopefully will be approved by the Greek government as it requires their permission and takes 5 to 10 years to complete. Let's just say for now, that the space where the event with take place, will be a "Metaverse blackhole". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sounds awesome. How can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking for speakers, people to help, sponsors, media sponsors and in general cool people :) If you are one of them or you can suggest someone, join the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/XvCttdjTAM"&gt;Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;. There is a room to coordinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super excited and super stressed but it is going to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;

They have this epic NFT, pixelated and animated by me, stored in the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and on IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First edition" src="/images/jonscake.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/piece-of-cake_v2s1Oc8vg1/"&gt;second edition&lt;/a&gt; costs &lt;strong&gt;Ξ 0.1&lt;/strong&gt; (UPDATE: it is sold out!), there are only 40 copies and has &lt;strong&gt;unlockable content&lt;/strong&gt;. The content is a numbered acrylic art block that contains the NFT and I will ship it wherever you live. For free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't understand, this NFT comes also with a physical product, send to your place for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unlockable content" src="/images/gift.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This NFT release pushed me to work more on our brand new infrastructure at &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some more geeky details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Piece of cake" is running on the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and IPFS. It is 100% decentralized running on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you buy the NFT, it is immediately available AT NO COST at OpenSea. You can trade it there and make some sweet ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limited Edition NFT has unlockable content that is uses your wallet signature to unlock it and off-the-chain authentication. I am planning to open source this part because I haven't found anywhere how to do this at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is built on Python/Flask, TailwindCSS and Solidity 0.8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops is still a hybrid. Some of our creators are not on the website, others are but we linked them on OpenSea or Rarible and some of them are 100% on the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops will become a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) by the end of 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops DApp can be integrated with other websites &lt;strong&gt;with just one line of code&lt;/strong&gt;, helping artists sell their NFTs directly from their websites. How epic is that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in beta testing, sending me an email and we'll get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More technical details coming at a later post, so sign up to stay in the loop or drop by my &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/gEnk5f4web"&gt;Discord channel&lt;/a&gt;. Oh and don't forget to &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/pieceofcake_limited/"&gt;buy the NFT&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

But as it happens with all new opportunities, the line between idiots and informed investors is blurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2021 I decided to dance on that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a huge supporter of the blockchain technology mostly because I am a huge geek. Surprisingly &lt;a href="https://jon.io/trading-ethereum-making-10-every-20-minutes"&gt;this worked really well for me&lt;/a&gt; at a time where Ethereum was $8-$12 (now it is $1500-$2000). I kept following very closely all the new trends and trying to figure out what is &lt;strong&gt;"the next big thing"&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are following the crypto space (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Doge etc) you know that every week there is a new "next big thing". Finding whether this is an unstoppable Tsunami or not is how fortunes are made. Or lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real metric that works is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do people use it RIGHT now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't care if it is great on paper, if the price is high or if Elon Musk is pushing it. Do people &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; use it? Is there a &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt; around it building software and new tools? &lt;strong&gt;Is there a future&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFT: Non-fungible tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are the newest hype. Millions of dollars in transactions and to tell you the truth, I love how they disrupted the art gallery space. Anyone can buy and sell art while sitting at home, drinking kombucha and watching Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get what NFTs are is to understand that they represent ownership. An NFT is used mostly for digital items but there are tons of others of use cases that I'll explore in another post. Let's see an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an artist and I digitize my work (I take a photo) and I upload it to one of the current trading platforms for NFTs (like &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/"&gt;Opensea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/"&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;). The process of converting my art to NFT is called minting and during that extremely simple process I can also add some properties to my NFT (we call them metadata). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example this is an NFT that just got sold $215k as I was writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/punk.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has some properties (Accessories and Type) and it is unique, meaning that whoever bought this, is the unique owner of this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait? Why is it unique? I can download it for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the argument that I keep hearing about NFTs. Why would I buy it if I can get it for free? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to &lt;strong&gt;perceived&lt;/strong&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are literally thousands of copies of Mona Lisa. But only the original one can capture all the value. NFTs are on the blockchain so you can always know whether this is the original or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I cannot have it on my wall and enjoy it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have my Tesla stocks on the wall. And (sadly) the vast amount of expensive art is locked up inside vaults and sometimes even at the museums you don't see the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art can  be enjoyed and also be traded for money. You can have a piece of art that is not enjoyable but worth millions of dollars and art that is a masterpiece but worth less than a doge coin ($0.005). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs create new, efficient and fast marketplaces for anyone to upload their art, purchase, speculate and invest in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How big is the NFT space right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been buying and selling since 2018 (the &lt;a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/"&gt;Cryptokitties&lt;/a&gt; days) but now it is out of control. We are talking about buying something for $50 and selling it for $30k in less than a month. The NBA started &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/"&gt;their own NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, celebrities are &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/grimes-art-sold-nft-cryptocurrency-auction-elon-musk-warnymph"&gt;printing money&lt;/a&gt; and more and more and &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-enjin-bring-cross-platform-custom-nfts-to-minecraft-2021-02-11"&gt;more companies&lt;/a&gt; jump into the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, a myriad of companies are building tools and making sure everything is faster, cheaper and more accessible for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should I spend all my money buying NFTs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT market is very volatile and moves extremely fast. It is the definition of FOMO and hypecoaster (hype going on a rollercoaster). Read as much as you can, research the hell out of it and understand that whenever you think it is a smart investment, it probably is a stupid one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hey, you didn't tell me the story of how you made 50%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes! I hate clickbaiting so here is the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/hash.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, use a new wallet for any big transcations that you are planning to do. If you don't know the reasons then you probably haven't done any big transactions so you are ok for now (hint: security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, join as many discord channels as you can and read about the company that has issued that NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the NFT stored on &lt;a href="https://www.ipfs.com/"&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;? Is the NFT using a non-audited smart contract? Is the NFT &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-market-top-signal-fake-banksy-nets-over-1-million-in-eth-sales"&gt;actually real&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your due-diligence is legit then you have to assess whether this is a speculation game or a long term investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal with Hashmasks was to buy as many &lt;strong&gt;entry levels&lt;/strong&gt; Hashmasks as I could (the cost was 1-2 ETH etc) and keep them for 2-3 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the average price started going up (by 50% to 4x), the same thing happened to my hashmasks. I was getting offers without having my mask on sale - a sign that the market is super hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT is a brand new space and every investor should know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or every fool.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Trading"></category><category term="popular"></category></entry><entry><title>Maximize what you love, minimize what you hate</title><link href="http://jon.io/maximize-what-you-love-minimize-what-you-hate" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-02-06T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 was a very strange year for all of us. A year where we had to reinvent ourselves and slow down. Slow down to think, slow down to reprioritize. Slow down to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 was a very strange year for all of us. A year where we had to reinvent ourselves and slow down. Slow down to think, slow down to reprioritize. Slow down to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was a year I learnt a lot about me and what fuels me for a 10x performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt how to shoot my own videos (poorly), edit them (poorly-times-2), build better financial models for &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;AgentRisk&lt;/a&gt;, built products (that make money) faster and how to build a bigger audience that matters &lt;strong&gt;to me&lt;/strong&gt;. I even had a freaking 1 hour interview with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrES48wX6CQ"&gt;Ice-T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad(?) thing is that I acquired some skills that I DEFINITELY didn't want. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I posted an article about how to &lt;a href="the-joy-journal"&gt;find the things that you love&lt;/a&gt;. This year I collected more metrics and I came closer to the things that make my day better. Maybe some of these findings can be applied to your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lords of Summer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood_of_the_month.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that I moved to Los Angeles is because it is summer all year long. I love &lt;a href="addictive-design-using-unpredictable-rewards"&gt;the sport of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; but this summer I was also involved in a &lt;a href="how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country"&gt;huge humanitarian project&lt;/a&gt; where I architected and coded a whole system from scratch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I freaking loved it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really missed writing code and building products that &lt;strong&gt;just work&lt;/strong&gt; instead of making sure I don't upset the SEC. Yes, having your own wealth management company and managing millions using algorithms might sound exciting but after a while it is soul crushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that put me in an interesting situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the CEO of the best Wealth Management company in the planet is an amazing ego booster. It is a social status that is higher than "a guy writing code and building stuff".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems that it just is "not fun" for me. I definitely plan to fix this this year by "making investing fun again". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly regulated areas that you cannot innovate fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;only wealthy people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekend Warriors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood_of_the_week.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mood this year was way better than last year (this is also attributed that I am a positive person in general and to my support network - I love you all btw) but there is a distinguishable uptick on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturdays are my "project" days. The days where I get to build small experiments to try ideas. Experiments that I have zero expectations that will ever get any traction but I've seen a couple of them getting a couple of thousand of followers. This blog is also one of these experiments by the way. It is also the days where I meet with friends and we barbecue in the backyard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridays were my "meeting" days. I used to pack all my meetings on a Friday. Now I dedicate 3 hours *&lt;em&gt;per week&lt;/em&gt; in meetings that I won't learn something new or have an insane fun time. I plan to bring this down to 30 minutes per week by outsourcing everything to my (kickass) EA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No expectation experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending more time with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I started focusing more on "life design" (I'll post more about &lt;strong&gt;life design&lt;/strong&gt; in the following weeks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life design helps you build your day, week, month and year in a way that creates a perfect flow for you. It usually requires you to reprioritize your whole belief system but the main gist is if you are not ecstatic about something, you shouldn't do it. This new navigational framework is making ripples on the rest of my life as old milestones (like raising money for my company or even selling it) become swamps that will slow you down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core lies in finding the things that you are madly in love with and center your life around them while avoiding the things that you hate. Definitively not as easy as it sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs you to be true to yourself, crash your ego and reevaluate your whole day/week/month/year/life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of these things that starts as a whisper and ends up as a roar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone sends you an email for a meeting. You are "so and so" but because you are polite, you respond and have the 30m meeting that goes nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;definitely not&lt;/strong&gt; a HELL YEAH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I am not checking email (sometimes for a week) and then on new emails if it is not a &lt;strong&gt;hell yeah&lt;/strong&gt;, I might not even respond. I know, it sounds like an asshole move and I ALWAYS tried to respond to everyone in the past but this is not aligned with my current life design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard your time and &lt;a href="https://jon.io/3-tricks-to-smash-your-goals"&gt;control your calendar else someone else will control your life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I convinced you to spend at least 10 minutes and write down the things that you love and the things that you hate. It is the only step to become better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Best way to measure real KPIs?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am building a course for Founders and I am coding my own platform for it (it's a long story) and the simplest way to see if the content is interesting was to start a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;simple newsletter course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first couple of days, I got more than 100 founders going through the course but I wanted to see how many of them are really interested about the full course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the last email where I talked about the course, I &lt;strong&gt;DIDN'T ADD THE LINK&lt;/strong&gt; to the full course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f3.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f7.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f8.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 founders sent me an email like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 people that are interested in the course &lt;strong&gt;that much&lt;/strong&gt; to send me an email (or ping me on social media).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people will click to check out the website shouldn't matter when you are trying to validate a product. 
You should be interested in how many people really want to connect with you and ask more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. Force your users to really ask about your product

Your mission is to destroy Germany's ability to wage war and free up the skies for the Allied Forces. The problem is that your Bombers are being zapped out of the sky like mosquitos drawn into the fire in a summery night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German anti-aircraft fire and Luftwaffe  - the German Air Force - are making your life hard. You cannot afford losing more Bombers and more personnel else the war is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to most problems is data. Data is also the culprit of most problems but that is a different post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WWII, the United States after suffering terrible losses turn to Statistical Research Group (SRG) that had the best statisticians in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/plane.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombers had to be reinforced with metal in order to cover any weak points. Sadly, you cannot cover the whole plane with additional metal as metal is heavy. The weakest points had to be identified and only these points had to be patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collection started with analyzing the location of the bullet holes that were found on the Bombers that made it back safely. The obvious idea was to patch the areas that had the highest concentration of bullet holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More bullet holes around the wings? Patch that part. More bullet holes around the tail? Patch the tail. Data driven decisions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for the missing bullets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one critical issue with that theory: The US collected data from the planes that made it back, the planes that survived and obviously weren't blown out of the sky. If anything, they should have been looking to patch &lt;strong&gt;the areas that had no bullet holes at all&lt;/strong&gt;. The planes that went down were never included in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Wald from SRG suggested, the  bombers were going down because they were shot &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; the engines - an area that had zero bullet holes on the returning planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making assumptions based on a winning, surviving dataset is called &lt;strong&gt;Survivorship Bias&lt;/strong&gt; and it can be devastating for Entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for missing opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to idolize the person that worked for 5 years in a bad idea but at the end made it and now is a multimillionaire. Or the Entrepreneur that left a well paying job and decided to build a new company and now he has more money than the budget of a small European city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Entrepreneurs, we learn to listen to the data but what happens when our whole dataset is made up from "planes that survived"? What happens when only 1% of bombers make it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing the blind spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have blind spots. Every single one of us. We become better by making these spots as small as we can. We do that by stepping back and looking at the big picture instead of getting closer and closer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From up close, even a dot seems like a huge black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in finding what "brings us down" is start looking for what might be missing. A good example is customer reviews. 
Relying &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; on customer reviews is a terrible idea to improve your business. I know a Startup that had brilliant reviews but was bleeding customers. The majority of these customers never cared to provide any feedback - they just hated the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same happens when you ask  for opinions from your friends or family. Even if they are hard on you, it is no comparison with the feedback you will get from strangers that don't care about your feelings. I am not saying that "all feedback is good", you still have to filter it but at least collect as much as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you like getting blown out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>How I spent my summer, helping to save a whole country</title><link href="http://jon.io/how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-10T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

It was kind of a cheap shot as “huge secret project” are my trigger words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked me if I can join him on a Zoom at 6am. I told him that I am not going to wake up that early even if the President of Greece was on that Zoom call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the Prime Minister and his team of scientists were on the call and I was there, 7am in Los Angeles, half awake, wearing my “A.I pays my bills” t-shirt. The “huge secret project” was not clickbait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to build something that has never been built before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know Greece, I assume it is because you hate good food, sunshine, breathtaking beaches, history, and you haven’t watched “My Big Greek Fat Wedding”. And this comes from someone that is 100% impartial on this (being Greek doesn’t mean I cannot be impartial, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo by Jonathan Gallegos on Unsplash" src="/images/greece-ml.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece has a population of 11 million and during non-COVID19 summers, the country hosts more than &lt;strong&gt;33 million tourists&lt;/strong&gt;. This is &lt;strong&gt;more than 3 times the population of the entire country&lt;/strong&gt;. They all come to Greece and spend most of their time on the (tiny) Greek Islands. Oh, and most of them come &lt;strong&gt;during the three (summer) months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism also supports nearly a quarter of the country’s jobs and represents 20% of the nation’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of COVID19, this is a double-edged sword for the country. On one hand, keeping its borders closed to tourists equals &lt;strong&gt;financial suicide&lt;/strong&gt; for Greece — a country that had just started to recover from a previous financial hardship. On the other hand, blindly accepting &lt;strong&gt;100K to 300K tourists PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt;, translates to “Death by COVID19”, by putting the locals at risk of infection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no country that has the capacity to conduct these many tests or this kind of infrastructure or solution to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Meet EVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is a country-wide AI screening and testing program , thought to be the first of its kind in the world, which has been online since July 1st 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EVA" src="/images/eva.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are one of the lucky ones that can work remotely. What better place to work from than the seaside, munching on tasty Mediterranean food. Again, 100% impartial on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your arrival in Greece, you must fill out an online “passenger locator form” (we call it PLF) providing basic information including which country they are coming from, gender, age, and other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting your information to the GDPR-compliant system (Europe is extremely careful regarding how personal data is stored and handled), a subset of anonymized data arrives to EVA. EVA takes into account how many other people will arrive at the same entry point, availability of tests, and your personal risk profile and responds with a “TEST” or “NO TEST”. All in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “test/no-test” information is sent back to you via email and encoded as a QR CODE that will be scanned upon your arrival in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immigration officer will know at the time of scanning whether you should be sent for testing or you are free to continue your vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sent for testing, your (anonymized) lab results will be fed back to EVA to improve the model and its accuracy — closing the self-learning loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By digitizing the details of a visitor’s trip, Greece can make informed decisions on who should be tested, how tests should be allocated, or whether any borders need to be closed due to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How good EVA is?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion (using only public data) is that EVA is working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04014-z"&gt;The paper that details EVA made it into Nature!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Greece has less than 20 new external infections from 100k visitors per day. The total infections are on average 150 to 200 mostly to internal spread of the virus which is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know any other country that managed to stay open for as long as Greece while having thousands of tourists per day and open bars and restaurants. Of course if Greece wants to keep infections low, will have to impose stricter controls to manage “internal infections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA might seem like a “Deus Ex Machina” but as Greeks say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot expect everything from the Gods — you also have to put some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TeamEVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is the brain child of three very smart people. And me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="My Generative Art" src="/images/genart.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we perceive shapes and ideas when we are forced to limit ourselves? Can we extract the basics of a product by eliminating the unnecessary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This bicycle does not exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to &lt;a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/"&gt;ThisPersonDoesNotExist&lt;/a&gt; and you keep refreshing the page, you will see every time a photo of person that doesn't exist. That photo has been generated by a Machine Learning algorithm that mashes millions of photos together and comes up with a new face every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine introduced me to &lt;a href="https://www.gianlucagimini.it/portfolio-item/velocipedia/?fbclid=IwAR3mtHozjRDKoawWPS6PcYeltg4jvZucLnvuj4RrGkWWeRlVr0fhk5cvZv8"&gt;Velocipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a project where people are asked to draw bicycles from memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bicycle" src="/images/artbike.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the bicycles drawn have some vital flows. &lt;strong&gt;These bicycles cannot exist&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gianluca Gimini says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about we do this for building products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Product Does Not Exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months I am building a new platform that teaches you how to build a Startup &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; and the number one problem is overthinking about your first version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the majority of founders are building their prototype without ever talking to at least 10 customers. Crazy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am (obviously) guilty of overthinking too when it comes to product development so I decided to ask 20 users to draw, using only pen and paper, the landing page and one functional page. This could work with just 5 users by the way. This is the message that I've sent them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sent by me" src="/images/sentbyme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try it yourself if you want before seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I've learnt from the landing pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/ What &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like is not what my users like&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/proone.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90% of the landing pages had a video/teaser which is something &lt;strong&gt;my design didn't have&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't like having videos in landing pages but it seems that for educational content, it is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/protwo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ Users expect discounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/prothree.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the designs had a "free week" or "buy now and get X% discount". &lt;strong&gt;I have this too&lt;/strong&gt; (you get most of the chapters for free) but not in that prominent space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Testimonials were not such a big theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/profour.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every landing page that had testimonials didn't dedicate a lot of space to them and it was usually on the second page (under the fold). &lt;strong&gt;That was my wrong assumption&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking that I needed to have a good amount of testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4/ Pay attention to interesting ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/profive.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some landing pages that were 100% different from the rest. I am definitely going to integrate some ideas from them. It what makes products different, interesting and fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I've learnt from the functional pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5/ Video is king - but text is his Queen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes, action lists, descriptions and extra resources. &lt;strong&gt;I HAD NO IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;.
 
Now it makes sense. Users want more material and want to be able to go back and look at their notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/prosix.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/ Group chat and discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/proseven.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much more difficult feature but it seemed important for a lot of users. I would try using Slack/Discord before building something into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Perfect User Does Not Exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have built the landing user-generated landing page waaaaaay faster than the one I designed. Making assumptions and believing in them is the worst way to build a Startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how your users can use your product, eliminate all your biases. Give them a pen and paper and tell them to draw the UI. Focus on the commonality, build fast and have them try it out again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you cannot make everyone happy. The Perfect User Does Not Exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A huge thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goes to everyone who sent me their drawings! You get free access to the course &lt;strong&gt;forever&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the course, don't forget to sign up to the &lt;a href="/pages/weekly-tips"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go and make some products that don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my life 4 years ago and I can tell you that none of these calls went as I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 2 years later, $1M raised in a week - mostly uneventfulness. This is not some weird flex as everyone knows that fundraising is a soul-crashing experience, regardless how easy it may seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People are stupid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever discussed with someone about politics, art, music, sports, food, drinks, fashion, science or let’s say &lt;strong&gt;anything on any subject&lt;/strong&gt; then you agree with me (if not, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are stupid): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are stupid because YOU are right and they cannot see how wrong THEY are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, you cannot always scream "YOU ARE AN IDIOT" to their faces and go on with your day. Sometimes you need to convince them that your argument is solid and theirs it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are trying to raise money for your company and the investors cannot understand that your idea will be more earth shaking than the second coming of Jesus. Or that your political party is the only one that can save the country or why keto diet is the best diet in the world or why Bitcoin is a scam (it is a scam - please don’t argue with me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why people cannot stop being stupid and just agree with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The backfire effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are situations where the evidence are on your side. Literally like “the earth is not flat” kind of evidence, backed by science and backed by anyone else that has IQ over 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, there are people that THEY JUST DON’T get it. &lt;strong&gt;And what do you do?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You argue. You confront them with more and more and more evidence. More data. But they still act irrationally and cannot be convinced regardless the amount of evidence and data they are presented to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the called &lt;strong&gt;the backfire effect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is irrational, any evidence presented to them  is “fake” or irrelevant. Confronting them with more evidence &lt;strong&gt;cements&lt;/strong&gt; their belief because now you are treating them as if they actually have a valid argument and you are trying to debate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current Startup being a Wealth Management company, I have billions of stories to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When insanity knocks on your door&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage people’s money for a living. I’ve been also managing my money for a long time. That doesn’t mean that I am the best one out there (hint: I actually am) but I run circles around non-professional investors. Again, not because I am smarter but because I am using data and this is what I do full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people I met that have 100% wrong opinion about the market, about stocks, about what to buy and what to sell, &lt;strong&gt;is staggering&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more mind-blowing is that it is pretty easy to prove that I am right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My investments make more money than their investments. It is super clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, they cannot be convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met people that lost 30% of their money and they are still convinced that they did better (I am screaming silently, HOW?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super interesting crazy fact is these exact same people will trust a con salesman and get ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to convince the inconvincible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that you cannot convince everyone. Some people might have their own personal reasons and they will never share them with you. It is exponentially more difficult with people that they &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; they know better and &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; that they are smarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid those people. They are toxic and a total waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest, there is one simple question. One question to start the “conversion” process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find something that could be improved or that makes you unhappy with your current choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small crack of light will let you see their perspective and with &lt;strong&gt;empathy&lt;/strong&gt; you can understand why there is a push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a “flat-earther” what is &lt;strong&gt;one thing&lt;/strong&gt; that they disagree with the “flat earth theory”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask an investor if they could turn back time, what they would have made different. Any investments that might have be avoided? Any lost opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use empathy to relate and approach their point of view and I GUARANTEE you that even the most difficult and rigid people will crack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they are idiots, doesn’t mean that you should be too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why is everyone surfing right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blame it to the lockdown or to a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3SMg088j8"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt;, surfing seems to have attracted a lot of people the last 6 months.

If not, let me introduce you to &lt;strong&gt;surfing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is everyone surfing right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blame it to the lockdown or to a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3SMg088j8"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt;, surfing seems to have attracted a lot of people the last 6 months. Or maybe because &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; started surfing like a maniac. This is called by the way the &lt;strong&gt;Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt; or frequency bias. It is the same as buying a car and then you keep noticing that there are so many people driving the same car are you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried surfing as soon as I moved to Los Angeles from San Francisco. And I sucked. I mean, I enjoyed it and was spending more than two hours fighting with the waves and making little progress but swimming + exercising + friends is a pretty sweet deal. Then, I stopped. Until 6 months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hooked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unlocked the next stage of surfing randomly, when I went to a beginners surfing point just to get some exercise, having &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; expectations about riding a wave. Oh, little did I know. All of a sudden I could ride waves. &lt;strong&gt;I COULD SURF&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems that trying to start surfing in a 3-4 feet waves which trust me &lt;em&gt;are huge&lt;/em&gt; when you are confronted by them, isn't the best intro for surfing. It builds your skills though: balance, explosiveness, paddling in the water and knowing how to dodge waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it. I was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The sport of the Gods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winds are traveling the universe and end up on Earth caressing the ocean to create waves, harnessing the gravity of the moon and the sun and then this powerful and majestic mass of awesomeness is calling you to try and ride it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing similar to this feeling in the whole universe. You cannot be more connected with everything. You cannot feel smaller yet bigger than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not why surfing is so addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dogs, cats and rats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlof find out that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any behavior that is rewarded, is likely to be repeated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He figured out that when a bell rings and you immediately reward a dog with treats, the dog will be condition to expect a treat (and salivate) whenever a bell is rung. We all know how this works and applied to products but Skinner took it waaaaay further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. F. Skinner was the father of behavior analysis. If you don't know about Skinner, please read this excellent book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner figure out that he can boost the "salivating" (even though he was using mostly rats) by randomizing the reward. 
The rats were hitting a lever and they were getting a reward but not everytime. Sometimes the reward was small. Sometimes huge. Sometimes there was no rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rats were going crazy waiting for their random dopamine hit. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules_of_reinforcement"&gt;This variable schedule of rewards&lt;/a&gt; is more effective that what Pavlof found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why surfing is so addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your board, waiting for the next "perfect" wave. Tons of waves come but none is perfect. Sometimes you spend 30 minutes just waiting. And then the universe sends you a wave. Randomly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it and immediately you have an adrenaline rush. Dopanine is already hitting you, even before catching the wave. &lt;strong&gt;This is it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start paddling, you feel the gentle push that is becoming violent and as you are connected with everything, time stops. Nothing else matters. &lt;strong&gt;This is it&lt;/strong&gt;. Your reward that you got sometimes was epic, medium or a face-plant to the water. Regardless of the reward though, you are hooked. You want to do it again. You crave for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unpredictable rewards in products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating this to a product is not as tricky as you think and it is used in almost everything already (gaming, social networks, casinos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is making any reward that you have for the user &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt;. Not in terms of time but in terms of benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gaming, any rewards should be randomized. You completed you quest? Fantastic! Here is your random &lt;strong&gt;loot box&lt;/strong&gt;.
For a platform that uses badges (which surprisingly are very effective), a &lt;strong&gt;random badge should be awarded&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a specific one. So many platforms are doing this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything that "unlocks" a next level - even buying a bigger plan, a random reward should be given. Users need to crave for the next cool thing that &lt;strong&gt;might get&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am experimenting with a Startup Course that I am building from scratch (everything, &lt;strong&gt;including the platform&lt;/strong&gt;) and I am seeing that random "powerups" have more than 60% engagement than predictable ones. Btw, if you want to participate in the beta of the Startup Course (The Donut Startup), &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;, send me an email and I'll send you an invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced unpredictable rewards that worked on you? I'd love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had a personal website but I always had a blog. First on tumblr, then Jon.IO using Mailchimp, then on Medium and then on Substack. I loved them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that &lt;a href="https://substack.com/"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; will be &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; blog/mailing list I will be using for a very long time (because substack is epic) but I wanted a little bit more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control = Conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, everything has to be calculated. How many users came to the website, from where, which pages are performing, which articles are shared the most etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Having my own website got me more than 2000 subscribers in two weeks with 5 articles &lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a fluke. But I've been doing this for some time now and I know how to talk with my audience and what my audience likes (hint: mostly Startups, trading and bad puns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I am building a Startup Course on my own platform (because I want to include some features than are fun and aren't available anywhere else) and I want everything to be under the same theme and under my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sure, sure. Why not NextJS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://substack.com/"&gt;NextJs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tailwindui.com/"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; let's you build website super fast. Like, come on. It is ridiculous how epic this combination is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that I don't like is using bleeding edge software for "boring things" like the infrastructure of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is extremely easy to hack around, it will be working as it is for the next decade and if not, I can rebuild it. You can see that
it &lt;a href="https://jon.io"&gt;Jon.IO&lt;/a&gt; doesn't look like the standard Pelican installation but it uses most of the nifty plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tailwind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea why but my (first) new version was not using tailwind and that was stupid. What you see here was built in less than a day and it is exactly how I want it to be - web and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuous deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously. Commiting to the master branch on Github, triggers a Github hook and the new article (which is written in Markdown) is posted.
The RSS feed is updated and SendFox sends automatically an email to the mailing list (depending on the category).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough with the stupid flexing. Is it opensource?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously. Go and fork here,  &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;sign up to the mailing list&lt;/a&gt; and ping me if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming Next: Building the best platform (on the planet) for courses using Google Cloud, Flask and TensorFlow &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>I tried a Digital Sabbath and it was epic</title><link href="http://jon.io/i-tried-a-digital-sabbath-and-it-was-epic" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-11T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three most harmful addictions are carbs, a monthly salary and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend too much time online. Way too much time. Based on Space (&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mrigapps.andriod.breakfree.deux&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-break-phone-addiction/id916126783?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes &lt;strong&gt;I spend more than 7 hours per day&lt;/strong&gt; just on my phone. Yes, sounds a lot and you will be surprised how much time you actually spend without even realizing. Google Maps, Spotify, Gmail, Phone calls, calendar, 
etc etc really adds up. See, I didn’t even add Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, as an Entrepreneur I don’t need an office but that means that I work a lot on the go (thus the glued phone on my hand). Nah, this is just an excuse! STOP FOOLING YOURSELF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for a change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday morning I decided to try a Digital Sabbath. What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Sabbath is a hipster way to stop using digital devices for a whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rules were simple: No phones, no tablets, no laptops and gaming devices. And definitely no Internet. Sounds easy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My morning started having breakfast in the backyard without having Netflix or YouTube in the background. And of course no music (no Spotify). Damn, I should have gotten an old fashion radio. Maybe order it from Amazon? Damn, no Amazon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I finished building a gym in my house that I’ve been postponing for some time but hey, Instagram stories during the weekends are so juicy (update: no, they are not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear my phone ringing (I should have turned it off but now I am not allowed to touch it) and probably it’s my friends trying to coordinate for coffee, drinks, activities. I hope someone drops by so I can tell them about my sabbath. And I really want to be blasting Black Sabbath when they arrive but I don’t know any Sabbath songs on the guitar except Paranoid and I cannot go online to find tablatures. Yes, this is &lt;a href="https://people.com/politics/trump-boasted-of-avoiding-stds-while-dating-vaginas-are-landmines-it-was-my-personal-vietnam/"&gt;my personal Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward, one of my friends dropped by for coffee and propagates the news to our network. I could hear the laughs behind every blink-blink of the Facebook Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it is time for coffee! And has to be somewhere near by as we have a No Google Maps policy. Or at least I cannot use Google Maps. As I wonder if we should go outdoors or indoors I almost caught myself asking “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”. Not today Google. Not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive at the coffee place while chatting in the car without anyone checking Twitter, Facebook or Instagram as I have this profound energy consuming the social space around me and I say “coffee is on me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Digital Sabbath made me realize how awesome technology is and how ingrained is in our everyday lives. And &lt;strong&gt;apparently you cannot even buy coffee at coffee shops without using a tablet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day turns into night and we go out for drinks and then food and I end the day reading a &lt;strong&gt;physical book&lt;/strong&gt; which I had mostly as decoration as I do all my reading on Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved every single bit (ha! puns!) of the experience. I really enjoyed waiting in line and not checking my phone and just watching people (checking their phones). It was a strange meditative exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually seemed that people became more talkative and open. Who knew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I doing it again next Saturday?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OF COURSE! But I will optimize it a little bit. This impromptu digital seclusion made communicating with friends &lt;em&gt;adventurous&lt;/em&gt; (at least in the beginning) as no-one knew about my experiment. Now they will know that we just have to stick to plans we made from Friday and they have to help me get coffee. Oh and I will definitely buy a small radio (in your face Spotify).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The #RoamCult: Why creating a cult for your Startups is what you should be doing right now</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-roamcult-why-creating-a-cult-for-your-startups-is-what-you-should-be-doing-right-now" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-11T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;Or why you should have a "Believer" plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurring revenue. Two words synonym to predictable revenue and known for bringing smiles and high-fives to VCs and founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single tech company I know has a recurring revenue business model. Even the big ones are trying moving to a SaaS model by becoming Cloud-first/ready or whatever bullshit (come on it is 2020 already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe there is a new business model. The Believer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about &lt;a href="https://roamresearch.com/"&gt;Roam&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago - a company that created a ton of buzz with their #roamcult and having a “Believers” plan. This is not an advertisement of the product and I am not an investor at Roam. But I am a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying $15 per month or $165 per year, how about you pay $500 for &lt;strong&gt;five years&lt;/strong&gt;? One of the pros is of course the 40% discount but what about the cons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Will the company still existing in five years? This is a brand new startup after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Having access to brand new features before anyone else is cool but is it that cool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting business model and definitely could spark a new trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Believers: Building your “cult”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some products that are epic. People love them. They just love them. They are irrationally obsessed with them. These are the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are the people that if you had a heavy metal band, they &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/metallica-drive-in-shows-1041638/"&gt;will travel 5 hours to see you performing a pre-recorded show in a drive-in&lt;/a&gt;. These people have a deep connection with your product and they get the maximum value out of it. It might even be part of their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can you identify your believers and how to give them incentives them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding your Believers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I built a Startup, there were some users that were a pain in the ass. Non-stop questions and criticism on a daily basis. My team has asked me giving them a refund and be done with it. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never let your believers get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that engage like crazy with your product/brand and are vocal, are your believers. Or your haters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers and haters are separated by a thin line called &lt;strong&gt;constructive feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn how to recognize the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to find your believers is by talking non-stop to your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending an email every month doesn’t cut it. Keep them in the loop with webinars, twitch broadcasts, previews of new features, asking for feedback etc. The believers are the people that log in the most and engage the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rewarding believers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An epic idea is something that Roam did with their “cult”. They gave the opportunity to their believers participate in the financial round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/roam.PNG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of your struggling to raise money, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Startup is giving the opportunity to its users to participate in the round. Not only the product is awesome, not only there are customers using it, there are users that love it so much that want to be with you for the long run. People knock on your door to give you money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty good scenario for fund raising in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t this like a one-time-fee thingy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It is more about the money. It’s always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product is the sum of the value it provides and the emotional connection that has with its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking that you can just add one plan in your pricing page and people will flock and turn into believers is naive. Oh sorry, it is not naive. It is actually stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a fan base/cult/believer requires that the company is transparent and let’s everyone (that wants to) participate in the decision making. In my opinion there hasn’t been enough innovation in pricing models and more experiments should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows. Maybe you can try creating your own cult and find new ways to make people connect with your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all find reasons not to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find reasons not to exercise (I don’t have time - I feel tired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find reasons not to eat healthy, find time for ourselves or maybe read that book that I bought from Amazon about bird watching and I am waiting for the weather to be perfect so I can sit in my backyard to identify the birds but it is a bit cold and I don’t know whether birds fly that much when it is cold, maybe next weekend or…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the chit-chat. Let’s do some smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 3 tricks to smash your goals RIGHT NOW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your calendar. Else time will control you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your energy levels. Else you are fighting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control who surrounds you. To flourish you need nutrients and not &lt;a href="it-is-bullshit-that-you-are-the-average-of-the-5-people-you-spend-most-time-with.html"&gt;toxicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 (bonus)/ Relinquish control. Practice no attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1/ Controlling your calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have tons of meetings back to back. I implemented &lt;a href="scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger.html"&gt;this trick from Arnold&lt;/a&gt; and it worked but I found a state of mind that was more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone asks for a meeting, I treat it as if they are stealing from my personal time. They are stealing from the time I have to help people, be with the ones I love or work on my company and my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me very conscious about random meetings and I dedicate more energy for the meetings that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a non-essential meetings is scheduled right now or after 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2/ Control your energy levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is literally a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love answering emails and writing articles in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like reading at 11am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be done with exercising before 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like having calls after 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to fit everything based “on time of the day” instead of your personal energy levels is 100% wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to listen to yourself and figure out the times you are more creative, have more energy or you need downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to do it is track when you kick ass in your &lt;a href="/the-joy-journal.html"&gt;Joy Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3/ Control who surrounds you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard that “you are the average Of The Five People You Spend The Most Time With”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are toxic and bad-mouthing others behind their back, that negativity will cloud your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are bitching all day long about how others are responsible for everything, you will never get charge of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="it-is-bullshit-that-you-are-the-average-of-the-5-people-you-spend-most-time-with.html"&gt;You will become the people that surround you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 (bonus)/ Relinquish control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Japan, I attended a seminar about Mandala. The idea behind it is that you spent A LOT OF TIME to create something beautiful and then you have to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it seems like the definition of wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this exercise taught me that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go is part of evolving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denounce control to regain control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you today with a video I got when I was riding the Bullet Train in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;how to love it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiating is the most important skill that any Entrepreneur should have. And it is the only skill that helped me save my company a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked before about &lt;a href="win-in-every-negotiation.html"&gt;information asymmetry&lt;/a&gt; which is a fancy word for knowing something that the other person doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two times I raised money for my Startup, I did it through &lt;a href="https://fundersclub.com/learn/safe-primer/safe-primer/safe/"&gt;SAFE&lt;/a&gt;. It also took me just a week to close the round but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAFE has many advantages (and disadvantages of course) but the most important advantage is that it gives you &lt;strong&gt;an informational edge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUMBER ONE issue that I face whenever I am fund raising is having the first couple of investors &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;. After that it is much easier. So much easier. But what usually happens is that everyone waits for the other person to make the first move and then &lt;strong&gt;ALL of them have to go together at the same time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/bulls.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even worse, you round has to close at a specific date and if you don't have all your investors lined up - poof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You.should.never.do.this&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAFE gives you the informational edge as your investors can come in random order. You can even have your round open all year long if you want. There is no start and end date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fund raising conversation should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey we have a round open, with minimum $25k to fund our sales. The cap is $10M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it more interesting is that you can give different terms to different investors (we call this &lt;strong&gt;high resolution investing&lt;/strong&gt;) based on how early they join the round, their importance or the amount money the put in your company. All with the same, super simple document. Pure epicness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For early investors, I am willing to give a cap of $3M and 10% discount. After I reach $500k, I won’t give any discount but one investor that I consider strategic I want her to join so I give her a cap of $2.5M and 10% discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 6 months, I am killing it but I have a couple of people that are still interested so then can join with a $5M cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same document. No legal fees. Plus, you don’t corner yourself by having to coordinate with all the investor and push them to commit before an end date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever tried doing fund raising using Converting Debt or equity, first of all you are an idiot and second of all open your eyes and see how it is done with SAFE. Unless you are a masochist.

&lt;p&gt;I have something to tell you that it is terrifying: It is bullshit because it is worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You will become the people that surround you.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your group is toxic and bad-mouthing others behind their back, you will start too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are bitching all day long about how others are responsible for everything, you will start too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they love their 9-5 job and you want to be an Entrepreneur, I have some bad news for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Action plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop anyone that is bad mouthing others&lt;/strong&gt;. And I am not talking about teasing. You need to focus your time and energy on building cool stuff and not talking about other people’s lives. Everyone has their own issues and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop bitching (unless it’s for releasing stress)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add diversity&lt;/strong&gt;. For me that was a huge pivotal point in my life. I am blessed that I have friends with different backgrounds, different opinions and different goals in life. Thank you :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put something recurring on the calendar&lt;/strong&gt;. I love having our Thursday basketball or our “guys night out” (where we don’t go out but we have barbecue). Creating traditions with friends is what creates stronger connections. Plus, if you cannot stand a person over a barbecue, well… you know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons in Information Asymmetry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to San Francisco, I didn’t have a car. Who needs a car in San Francisco? And the parking is like $350 per month so that is a hard no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lessons in Information Asymmetry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to San Francisco, I didn’t have a car. Who needs a car in San Francisco? And the parking is like $350 per month so that is a hard no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But sadly because I had a Startup, I had to go to Palo Alto, Mountain View, Oakland for meetings and events. That meant that I had to rent a car or waste hours on public transportation and Uber/Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Startup that never raised money from a VC, I knew we had to rent a car but our budget was best case $1200 per month. That’s $66 per day, including insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Information Asymmetry.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information asymmetry is a fancy word of saying “I know something that you don’t”. You can use that when you negotiate for a job, with customers, with sales people and you girlfriend/wife when it is time to do the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first step, we need to identify our &lt;strong&gt;informational advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The informational advantage I had was the length of the rent. 30 days is not usual. I decided to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to rent a car, the typical conversation goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I would like a car from that date to that date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I see, we have this model and that model for $12 more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking for the cheaper option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it, that is $100 per day plus insurance, plus taxes for 3 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using information asymmetry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I would like a car for three days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I see, we have this model and that model for $4 more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, what is the price for the cheaper model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be $100 per day plus insurance, plus taxes for three days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is roughly $100 per day, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we do something better if I wanted the car for a week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do $95 if it is for week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing! Thank you a lot. You know what, if we can do something better in terms of pricing, I could go for three weeks as I don’t want to bring the car back again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. The best I can do if you go for a whole month is $90&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you! That is perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we used information asymmetry was by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; revealing all the information we had in one go but in a &lt;strong&gt;dripping style&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can it work when you negotiate your salary? Of course it can!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to gather as much information as you can before going for an interview. That means knowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average salary for that position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average salary for that position in &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other possible perks (extra stocks, more vacation days)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this information, we are in an informational disadvantage as we have no idea whether the salary that we want is &lt;strong&gt;even feasible&lt;/strong&gt; for that company. Yes, an engineer can make $350k in a public tech company but in a small Startup that is doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my whole professional career, I managed to get &lt;strong&gt;way more&lt;/strong&gt; than any other of my peers in terms of salary, bonuses, stocks and vacation days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if it sparks revenue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I am the person that has 53 different hobbies and is good at three of them. And I don’t plan changing any time soon as I subscribe to the &lt;a href="jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything.html"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if it sparks revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I am the person that has 53 different hobbies and is good at three of them. And I don’t plan changing any time soon as I subscribe to the &lt;a href="jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything.html"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything&lt;/a&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am like a hoarder that finds “joy” in everything. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Startups, I have to be more intentional. I don’t use the word “focused” because this term is used by people that have one brain cell and cannot do more than two things at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating the unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt; is the most critical skill in a Startup and companies folded in just two weeks after Corona Virus started because they were on a “hiring spree, renting bigger offices” instead of “focusing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Marie Kondo give us some tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The KonMari rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KonMari method has six rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit yourself to tidying up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine your ideal lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish discarding first. Before getting rid of items, sincerely thank each item for serving its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidy by category, not location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the right order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself it it sparks joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s “Silicon Valey” these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1/ Clean up your business data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Commit yourself to tidying up” is the best advice for getting all your data in one place. If you don’t know how things are, how do you know what to improve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goals in Google Analytics that no-one is checking out? Clean them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Instagram account that you keep posting but you don’t track any conversions? Goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2/ Imaging your ideal “exit”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to build a business that makes tons of revenue? Is this an acquihire game so you don’t really need a lot of customers? Do you want to raise money and work hard to keep VCs happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about your future. “Imagine your ideal lifestyle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3/ Firing before hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be pretty obvious but 99% of VC-funded companies seem to have no idea how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before randomly hiring people and celebrating your “headcount”, ask if every single employee provides value to your mission. More employees that you just hired to satisfy your investors means more stress on your financials, slower product development, more red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t hire 100 engineers. Hire ten 10x engineers (yes, I hate that term too, just play along).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie said it loud and clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish discarding first. Before getting rid of items, sincerely thank each item for serving its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that you might want to give something more than just a thank you for your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4/ Hire the best: Location is irrelevant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I got the “Tidy by category, not location” and I opened it up a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in the past about &lt;a href="why-i-love-working-remotely-and-why-your-company-cannot-and-never-will.html"&gt;working remotely&lt;/a&gt; and if you company STILL doesn’t allow remote working I can assume that you are running a coffee place or a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5/ Follow the right order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are “cleaning up” your company, you should prioritize customers/sales, support, product development and then anything else. Nothing else should matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you taking the whole company to Tahoe this winter? Awesome. Make sure that everything else is in place first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6/ Ask yourself if it sparks revenue/value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you are doing needs to have only one goal: revenue (or adding value to customers). No-one cares about a better looking website. Or about using the latest in backend technology. Or that you have 34303403011 employees in 232 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOES IT MAKE MONEY?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, I was surprised because the most important question someone that wants to start a business should ask is how to make a product that people want. Anything else is details. Short of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises we had, was to think of a product that could generate $1 per month. If you think that is easy, I challenge you to try it out. It requires a pretty good amount of thinking and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations we had were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have one day to prepare&lt;/strong&gt;. That means no overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot spend any money (no ads)&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to use your existing network (friend, family, social networks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot use any external resources&lt;/strong&gt;. Getting creative or learning some basic building (and selling) skills is something you need to do if you want to run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you had all this in place, you had to pitch your idea to the whole class. Who knows, you might get some subscribers for your idea on the spot (hint: no one did but it is a good exercise treating everyone as a potential customer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw at least 30 different ideas that managed to make $1 to $250 recurring monthly revenue and to tell you the truth, it blew my mind. But more importantly it blew &lt;strong&gt;THEIR&lt;/strong&gt; mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proved that you don’t need a lot of money, huge infrastructure and 10 people to try out an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are wondering, the next step was to “build a company” that makes $1,000 per month then $10,000 and finally $1,000,000 per month. That way we could talk about &lt;strong&gt;finding a co-founder&lt;/strong&gt;, talk about &lt;strong&gt;funding&lt;/strong&gt; and how and when &lt;strong&gt;to scale&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more, I plan to post on a weekly basis my “how to Startup” so just &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;follow along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to making money from zero money. My favorite subject. 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by picking up an idea. We want something that might generate at least $1 per month. Write that idea down and place it as background in your phone. Like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by picking up an idea. We want something that might generate at least $1 per month. Write that idea down and place it as background in your phone. Like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mario" src="/images/mario.png"&gt;
I used Instagram to make this, so don't judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas to get your creative juices flowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram retouch service&lt;/strong&gt;. Retouch all photos that someone posts on social media. I know a friend that makes $1500 per month just for light retouching. I even paid $10 on reddit to have this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jonking" src="/images/jonking.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Websites&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you know how to setup Squarespace? Or Wix? Or Wordpress? If not, you should. It is very easy. Charge for management fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online talent company&lt;/strong&gt;. It will sound silly but there many influencers on YouTube/Instagram/TikTok that have decent traffic and no idea how to monetize it. They will LOVE a manager to handle this. Leave a comment below if you want to learn more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this exercise is not to make money and retire in a Greek Island. It is to understand how sales and marketing works and making something that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you found your idea, time to get some customers and validate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with your friends, family and expand to your social media. After that you go on Reddit, Craigslist, your local newspaper and Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fantasize that you could do it, &lt;strong&gt;stop right now&lt;/strong&gt; and actually do it. And then send me your a screenshot of your hustle and &lt;strong&gt;I’ll be the first person to send you $1 via Venmo&lt;/strong&gt;. No bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>The beauty in being the underdog</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-beauty-in-being-the-underdog" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-29T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of podcasts …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last three months, I am (kind of) doing a show by Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs. I know, I know you are going to tell me that “everyone is doing a podcast or has a YouTube channel nowadays”. And I agree. But hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of podcasts out there and more YouTube channels about Startups and hustling that I won’t even bother looking for a link to back this up with some data. Trust me on this one. But 99% of those, talk to the same people about the same freaking thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you graduated from Stanford, had an idea, raised money and then the company got acquired? How awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the underdogs? The people that for one reason or another cannot go through that path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long live the underdogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being the underdog, the outsider. The person that has the least chances of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends told me that I thrive in that state because it removes the anxiety of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fail, it is expected. And if you succeed, you are 🚀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that being the underdog forces you in a continuous state of competition. You take nothing for granted and you need to keep fighting. Hustling. You have to keep finding ways to come on top so you innovate. You pivot. You take more chances and you cannot stop because you are not Number 1. Hell, you are not even in the first ten places!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what, sometimes everything just works. You get in that flow and things are starting to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The underdog mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, getting to that state is pretty easy. I just start something new that probably will fail majestically (like a book, a podcast or planning to become the Major of Los Angeles) that I have no idea how to do and I try to do it. Succeeding doesn’t matter (in the beginning) because I get to learn SO many cool skills and I get to get over my “everything has to be perfect” plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people love to watch Netflix or read a book. I just like to fail :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as Ice-T said in one of my episodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are good at something, you learn how to get good at something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest resolutions for 2020 was to guard my time and energy like Cerberus - the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that I need more time for my projects. Besides &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;AgentRisk&lt;/a&gt; that takes most of my time, I have tons of other projects that compete for my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are small - like releasing &lt;a href="why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands.html"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; in a printed version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other projects are on-going - like using &lt;strong&gt;petri dish for my biohacking experiments&lt;/strong&gt; or learning Russian. And others are much bigger - like the soon-to-be-released TV Show or improving my drawing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I could do 16 hours non-stop every day for 6 months and I wouldn’t be done with half of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the goal is not to be done. I enjoy the process. I literally enjoy having many hobbies and learning new stuff. &lt;strong&gt;And it only makes me better at everything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jack of all trades, master of none&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” is criminally stupid. It wasn’t even applicable when the whole of humanity was working on the fields and we had to specialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how to seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to learn about business. I don’t need to learn about the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to know about trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to know about economics. No need to know about computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket straight to unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reroute to remain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your “idol” and see how he/she knows more than their craft. &lt;strong&gt;Way&lt;/strong&gt; more. Usually, they merge ideas from different fields and create something new. &lt;strong&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any intelligent creator understands that you need to control the whole creative process and that means that you have to know way more than your main craft. The most successful musicians not only have their own record company but they have expanded to other fields totally unrelated to their profession. And they kick ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my friend Ice-T said in one of my episodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are good at something, you learn how to get good at something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you acquire a new skill &lt;strong&gt;at any level&lt;/strong&gt;, your chances of success are multiplying x2. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why people get intimidated when they hear about new projects. Usually, they struggle with just their everyday job and they cannot understand that to grow they need to be cross-pollinated by different skills in different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, being focused is &lt;strong&gt;an amazing thing&lt;/strong&gt; if you are a drone, want a 9-to-5 job and have zero creativity. But we are already suppressed enough in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your inner creator make a mess. That’s the only way we grow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Joy Journal</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-joy-journal" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-08T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

Data like weight, fat percentage, Resting Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Glucose levels and recently HRV, SP02, V0Max and a dozen more. Most of these data are tracked automatically by inexpensive hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I started tracking my mood on a daily basis, hoping to find any corrections that might be interesting.
&lt;img alt="data is king" src="/images/hrvdata.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;22.2% was epic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;70% was pretty good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7% was ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.8% was bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0% was terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was a pretty good year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is kind of difficult to explain and quantify “happy” as my definition of happiness is something between building stuff, lifting heavy weights (and getting physically injured), Startups (getting emotionally injured) and doing stuff with people I love. No pain, no gain, no happiness, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me on LinkedIn why my 2019 was (in general) a pretty happy year. Was it gratitude? Friends? Drugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have no idea. I remember being super happy with Katya and friends, laughing, going on the beach and chilling in the sun. I remember being happy when we did a kick-ass release at AgentRisk and I was dropping off Alex 11pm at his home — knowing that the whole team gave their 110%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t remember the exact moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;📖Enter Joy Journal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year I am trying a Joy Journal — with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy journal is a physical book where you right things that make you happy. Then, you keep doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, data geeks love actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My JJ (that’s how cool kids call Joy Journal — and by “cool kids” I mean only me at this moment) is like a normal journal but with more data. Whatever you have in your mind. Double it. And then double it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="data" src="/images/dataguy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use my phone instead of a physical book and I write down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time &amp;amp; date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who else is with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The environment (context)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why I feel happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also snap a picture and put everything in my Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to find the things (and the environment) that make me consistently happy and keep having more of it. No idea if that simple method will work out but it worths the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you tried a Joy Journal? Do you have any cool ideas?

That was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was 2015 and my Startup had just &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAJJC"&gt;got acquired&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://splunk.com"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-billion dollar Company in the Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Athens/Greece at that point and for the first time, I didn’t have to think 24/7 about customers, bugs and scaling the company. That was someone’s else problem now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that free mental cycles, I decided to focus my energy to something new (at least for me): a book. Or as I’ve been saying since then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BOOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched &lt;a href="https://whatidowithmyhands.com/"&gt;What I do With My Hands&lt;/a&gt; to my friend, &lt;a href="http://www.asiomou.com/"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/a&gt; and she loved the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I &lt;strong&gt;loved&lt;/strong&gt; the idea - she just played along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These 10 little Celebrities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met at my Airbnb in Athens (oh yes, I was staying in Airbnb all over the world for the last three years - hashtag StartupLife) and we came up with these cool(?) things that you can do with your hands. Why? Seriously, I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It was on my todo list for a long time" src="/images/handtrello.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the book spent &lt;strong&gt;five years&lt;/strong&gt; in my Trello todo list, taunting at me, laughing at me and promising eternal glory and recognition. The main reason was me, over-engineering the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to find the perfect layout, website, page, intro everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we all know, being a perfectionist is how you get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ship the fricking book!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a shifting year for me. I reevaluated so many things in my life but more importantly I decided that taking yourself seriously is the worst thing it can happen to your personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go back to basics and start creating more. And then some more. And then add on that. And the first step was releasing that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikve"&gt;Vivi&lt;/a&gt;, made sure that it renders correctly on even the oldest of Amazon Kindle and then fought with the Amazon’s layout creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a free template for the website, got the domain, hosted the website on Github Pages and here you go. Available on Amazon and (in the next couple of weeks) available as a coffee table book. You’ll be able to read it soon in all the hipster coffee places in San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t intend to make money from the book - I keep running “free book” promotions on Amazon but I can do only five days every 90 days. If you want to read it and don’t want to spend $2 on Amazon, send me an email and I’ll send you a PDF version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that whenever I do “soul projects” expecting returns or outside validation I hate the process and I end up getting bored. I know, it is kind of obvious but I keep forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I love working remotely (and why your company cannot and never will)</title><link href="http://jon.io/why-i-love-working-remotely-and-why-your-company-cannot-and-never-will" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-18T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

Yes, not a slice but a whole pizza. Don’t judge, this is my lunch and I have a long day/night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 9am in California and usually around that time, companies are ready to have their Standup where everyone talks for less than 10 seconds and says what was done yesterday, what needs to be done today and if there are any show-stoppers. In our case, everyone is working from another state (or country) and I can assure you it takes us waaay longer than 10 seconds. Waaaaaay longer. Not because we are apart but because we like to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am logging in today from Italy and the internet in this Airbnb keeps dropping all the time. And I feel a bit sleepy which is definitely the jet-lag and not the pizza. Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on my fourth Startup, I kinda know how not to annoy everybody with my stuttering voice so I have Google Fi and it works pretty good. Most of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Fi for the rescue" src="/images/googlefi.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for my co-founder Niko that has strategically selected the best noise-to-work-to-view place at a coffee place in New York (it is lunch time for him), Maria in Salt Lake City that is doing some upgrades in her house while showing us our new epic homepage (and her new patio), Rania grilling us (mostly me) for not having compliance approved any blog posts (ha, add this to the list!) while she is about to put the kids to sleep (is it 7pm in Athens/ Greece), Alex trying to fight off his food cravings by entering a meditative state through product development (three more hours to breaks his intermitting fasting in Los Angeles) and more people jumping on and off or reporting on Slack. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of us it is the beginning of the working day, for others the middle or the end which makes things tricky to plan. Oh and some people are on vacations (we have an unlimited vacations policy). Did I say good times? Good times again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in this environment for almost ten years and a half version of it at Splunk which acquired my last company, I can tell you why this is the best way to work. The healthiest and the happiest. And then I can tell you why your company cannot do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why we can do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, the whole team needs to be aligned. Needs to be aware that “working from everywhere” means that you need to make sure you have stable internet connection, no noise and that you can work concentrated. We cannot have someone that needs to be (micro)managed. You need to be self-motivated. And you need to be really good at what you are doing. Reeeeaally good. You need to be an one-army man/woman. But the reward is that you get to have pizza while building products and having fun with a view like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why your company sucks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups used to be about working from a garage with a team of super dedicated and smart engineers. They were makers. Creators. They could work all day/night and they would radiate passion and will inspire people to join them. Not only for the perks. Not only or the salary. But mostly for the vision.
I know that you are thinking “hey man, we need to pay bills and you cannot buy medical insurance with passion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct. But if you want to evolve as an employee (and as a person?), you need to demand more than just a simple transaction of “money &amp;lt;&amp;gt; time”: Someone gives you money, you give back your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let me give you an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built AgentRisk to help Entrepreneurs manage their money better. More transparently. We even provide free education for cryptocurrencies. &lt;strong&gt;No this is not a product pitch&lt;/strong&gt;. What I am trying to say is that every single customer we have, was an employee at some point and then became &lt;strong&gt;obsessed with a problem&lt;/strong&gt;. They worked like there is no tomorrow, failed, tried again, failed, tried again and then made it. They freaking made it. And I am not saying that they just made money. They are better, more rounded as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the reason why your company cannot let you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies hire people that don’t have passion. That don’t have vision. They need you to work 9–5 at an office so that a manager can nano-manage you. Vacations are not unlimited because they think you will be on vacations all the time. And of course you end up wasting time and time and time again in meetings (ok some companies are not like that but you get my point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least you get to pay the bills, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is not for everyone obviously and not everyone is a super engineer. The truth is in the middle and companies just don’t know how to run remote teams. It takes time and dedication and many times I prefer being with the whole team at an office (we fly all together in one place) than on Google Hangouts. But working from wherever you want, is liberating. And the pizza is not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>Scheduling meetings like Arnold Schwarzenegger</title><link href="http://jon.io/scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-12T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

I have to stop you right there and tell you that you are wrong and I am right and I am awesome and you should shut up and read this epic post that will change your life. Ready? Let’s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Total Recall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading a new book that talks about Arnold’s life, called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-Recall-Unbelievably-True-Story/dp/1451662440"&gt;Total Recall&lt;/a&gt; and he mentioned how he books appointments and generally manages his day and time. And when I say Arnold, I mean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_career_of_Arnold_Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in case you &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Mr._Olympia"&gt;didn’t understand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His trick is pretty simple and he’s been doing it for more than 20 years. Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn’t have a weekly or monthly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that Arnold doesn’t schedule ANY &lt;strong&gt;appointments&lt;/strong&gt; in the future. Do you want to talk to him? You can do it later today and that’s it. Or if it is super important, you can talk to him &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way Arnold can focus on what is &lt;strong&gt;important to him&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of having his whole life dictated by Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="What? It is an image of Arnold and a Calendar. Point made." src="/images/fat.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we are getting to the part where you say to yourself: I cannot do that! I have people to meet, business meetings, skype calls etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The part where you say bullshit to yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Founder (currently on my fourth Startup) and an Angel Investor and my schedule for at least three weeks in advance is sold out. And I am not bragging because &lt;strong&gt;this sucked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that if I (and the Governor of California) can do this, you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I decided to give it a try and not schedule meetings for more than 3 days in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some interactions, it was flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I want to ask you for a new crypto strategy, how is your schedule next week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello there! I try not to schedule any meetings that far into the future in order to focus on what’s important right now. Do you have time to meet tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! Let’s do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Jon, we are still trying to figure out how this integration will work. Maybe setup a meeting at the end of the month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Andy, I try not to schedule meetings that far into the future so let’s talk tomorrow or around the end of the month to set something up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, ok. Let me see if we can do something this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it didn’t work AT ALL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey man, we plan to have a Founder’s meeting in a couple of weeks from now. Are you coming (I need to confirm seating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yo, I suppose but can we please talk next week again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this bullshit TimFerris-y thing that you are doing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferris is a fake Entrepreneur, I am doing the Schwarzenegger thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will I keep doing it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 3 is almost over and again my life is dictated by Google Calendar but only 3 days in the future (faint hoooraaaay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The huge difference is managing my energy levels&lt;/strong&gt; (which maybe is more important than managing time) because I can arrange meetings based on what I feel working on right now and focus on what is important for me and the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broker is nothing more than a company that lets you trade (buy or sell) assets on a market through their platform. What is very important for algotrading is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker offers an API in order for us to place orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have a demo account to run your staging environment and experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spread is as small as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we don't really care about spread as we won't be doing High Frequency Trading any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though brokers are regulated, there have been incidents in the past couple of years, were brokers folded due to certain conditions. Be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wary if &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no reviews of the broker on the internet (or most of them are bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the broker offers you some crazy leverage (like 1:200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the broker seems to be in a very strange country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could happen is that you start making some money and you aren't be able to pull them out. Seriously. Super stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's switch to a happier note which is opening an account and placing our first programmatic trade. Whooha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href="http://www.oanda.com/"&gt;Oanda&lt;/a&gt; as a broker (I am not affiliated with them) and they offer a pretty decent API, libraries on github and a free demo account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and open a free &lt;a href="https://www.oanda.com/register/#/sign-up/demo"&gt;fxTrade Practice account&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.oanda.com/demo-account/login"&gt;sign in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you sign in to your demo account, go to &lt;strong&gt;Manage API Access&lt;/strong&gt;. There you can find your API key which we are going to use in our system to place trades. &lt;strong&gt;MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHARE THIS KEY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this is and all other posts is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/Forex-algotrading"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and you can install it and run it pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Oanda released a new (kickass) execution engine called &lt;strong&gt;v20&lt;/strong&gt; and they have released a new (improved) API. This post has been updated in order to use the new API but if (for any reason) you want to check the old code, it is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading/blob/86db3f7f567897ad74c1e611cf2d6f337f4a9c24/post3/runner.py"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. You lucky you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting to Oanda needs a conf file - which you can generate using a script that Oanda provides &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python-samples"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you can just create it yourself. Why would you want that? First of all when it comes to credentials (and my money), I prefer to know everything that is going on. And I don't like having to install PyYAML just to read a conf file. Feel free to use either method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, prepare to be amazed. The code is straight-forward. We initialize the API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;v20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;api-fxpractice.oanda.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;443&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;HERE GOES YOUR API KEY&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now let's place an order (buy 5000 units of EURUSD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ACCOUNT ID&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="n"&gt;instrument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;EUR_USD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Response: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;201&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the current price is as easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utcnow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isoformat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;T&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Z&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pricing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;instruments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;EUR_USD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;includeUnitsAvailable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;prices&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Buy at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super easy. Don't worry about what EURUSD is or how many units we are buying or what a market order is. For now, we have placed our first trade from our laptop and we are going to build our own API to place trades. Exciting stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read Oanda's documentation &lt;a href="http://developer.oanda.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see what else you can do with their API and find the Python library &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.Tons of examples are available from Oanda's github page &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python-sample"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, connecting to a real &lt;strong&gt;LIVE&lt;/strong&gt; algotrading system, running from my RaspberryPI at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757245/jonio/trades-nov.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be able to see the (almost) final program running and we'll talk more about Forex and strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have more feedback, ping me at &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;jonromero&lt;/a&gt; or signup to the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal outro. This is an engineering tutorial on how to build an algotrading platform for experimentation and FUN. Any suggestions here are not financial advices. 
If you lose any (or all) you money because you followed any trading advices or deployed this system in production, you cannot blame this random blog (and/or me).

&lt;p&gt;It is also a real example with real returns (and real production errors that cost me money) where you can see how to identify opportunities, why algotrading is awesome and why risk management can save your ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the another post of the series: &lt;a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html"&gt;How to build your own algotrading platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get this question almost on a daily basis. How can I find a good strategy? How can I built my own? Do I need to have a PhD in mathematics? Statistics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsflash: If I can write a strategy, anyone can write a strategy. Trust me on that. The only trick is to &lt;strong&gt;look for a simple one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: This post has been rewritten "at least" five times (as &lt;a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-s-dao-forking-crisis-the-bitcoin-perspective-1467404395"&gt;"The DAO drama"&lt;/a&gt; escalated) and it is the perfect example of a strategy doing a full circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started getting involved with &lt;a href="https://www.ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; early on as I really liked the "run your algorithms on the blockchain" thing. When the first DAO came out, I read everything about it and loved the idea.
You don't need to understand what Ethereum, theDAO, blockchain is at this point (I promise I will ramble on a another post). The same ideas apply to Forex, Stocks even Pokemon balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;     As I said before, simple ideas turn into (simple?) strategies.
     Complex strategies turn into mayhem that is impossible to backtest
     and deploy without errors.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; My four step - captain obvious - system &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally, have a specific way that I work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step one&lt;/em&gt; : Identify an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea in this case is that there are a couple of exchanges offering Ethereum and DAO tokens. What if there was an &lt;strong&gt;arbitrage&lt;/strong&gt; between those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step two&lt;/em&gt; : Manually test the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something "kinda works", I am on to something. All I had to do is execute all the steps manually and write down any fees, conditions or anything that should be documented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step three&lt;/em&gt; : Automate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is not a high frequency trading algorithm. There is a considerable amount of time risk (which you can eliminate as we'll see later on) but what I did could be done manually. The problem is that I would have to spend all time in front of my computer, checking if there is an arbitrage condition and if there was, I had to act fast and without messing up. Oh and I had to recruit five of my friends to scale this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I spent Presidents' Day writing a simple program that will replay all my manual steps. The program would crash and it was not more that 100 lines of code. This is the data collection stage where I see if there is an advantage that algorithms can give me. Advantages can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that be automated and run 1000 of times per seconds or 1000 times in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that thinks faster than I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has no feelings to screw up my system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is at least one or more conditions met, I will start building and rewriting the algo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step four&lt;/em&gt; : All in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am kidding and you'll see in a bit why risk management is super important in this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Arbitrage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's discuss a little bit about what this arbitrage was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is: "I wonder whether Kraken and Shapeshift have different prices for the same assets". This is a classic arbitrage case (Kraken and Shapeshift are "exchanges").
I could exchange DAO for ETH on Kraken, transfer ETH to Shapeshift, exchange ETH for DAO and send them back to Kraken and due to price inconsintencies I would end up with more DAO than I initially started! &lt;strong&gt;Risk-free money, the best kind of money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make money as long as
ETHDAO from Kraken  * DAOETH from ShapeShift &amp;gt; 1 (+ fees + gas). Very simple formula, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every cycle, was a 2% to 10% return of my capital. After a while, I started hitting the limits of Shapeshift and I had to make this run in parallel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is &lt;strong&gt;what would you do if you had an algorithm that makes you 10% of your money every 20 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;? The stupidest thing you could do is put tons of money into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the Greek word &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris"&gt;hybris&lt;/a&gt;, consider yourself lucky. Hybris is when you think that you are invincible, better than gods. And this is the biggest NO NO you can do in trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks, theDAO was hacked. 160 million dollars were stolen (or should I say frozen?) and noone knew what was going to happen. For me, this happened, 10 minutes before boarding a plane to fly to New York. &lt;strong&gt;Hybris&lt;/strong&gt;. Or as people in the US say: &lt;strong&gt;Fuck&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was smart(lucky?) enough to have good risk management habits (thank you Forex). I never, ever, ever risk more that 2% of my capital even if it seems the best kind of deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the money were "restored" and I could withdraw/convert my DAO to Ethereum (but yes, I bought in-flight WiFi to keep up with what's going on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole experience is a reminder that there are always things that you cannot predict. Things that you cannot control.
This was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_risk"&gt;systematic risk&lt;/a&gt; and there was no way I could have seen it coming. Pushing buttons and building algorithms is not enough. Proper risk management and knowing when you need to take a chill pill is what can keep you in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next post, I will post the whole algorithm and go line by line. I also plan to discuss a little bit more about theDAO and Ethereum. If you don't want to miss any of these and get some more additional info, feel free to sign up to the newsletter below where I talk about fintech, algorithms and the markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, if you want to make your own cryptocurrency and learn more about Ethereum, I have a great post with the code posted &lt;a href="hugcoin-build-your-own-cryptocurrency-coin"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Coming next: Diving into the ETHDAO algotrading program &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and trading is a very interesting subject. It is also a subject where you can spend tons of time writing code and reading papers and then a kid can beat you while playing Mario Kart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nexts posts, we are going to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize entries and exits. This and only this could make a ton of difference in your bank roll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate position size (in case you don't like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"&gt;Kelly criterion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find possible correlation between different pairs (pair trading). I love the EURUSD vs GBPJPY correlation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate support &amp;amp; resistance lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what is Machine Learning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;img src="theme/images/stallone.jpg" class="" alt="" /&gt; --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(image from &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3028414/how-facebooks-machines-got-so-good-at-recognizing-your-face"&gt;fastcompany&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms are algorithms where &lt;strong&gt;a machine can identify patterns in your data&lt;/strong&gt;. Yeap, it is that simple. For example, find all the animals in this photo and draw a box around them. Also, name that animal. Crazy I know. For trading as you can imagine it is pretty similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Find how can I make money based on this chart and do all the trades.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;wash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;underwear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;don&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t mix the colored with the whites&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a machine to "learn", you need to teach it what is right or wrong (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"&gt;supervised learning&lt;/a&gt;) or give it a big dataset and let it got wild (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"&gt;unsupervised&lt;/a&gt;). For identifying objects this is straight-forward but what about trading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing with data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around to see if there is any machine learning program that can identify S/R lines but to no avail. So I decided to write &lt;em&gt;the first machine learning program in python that identifies support and resistance lines in Python&lt;/em&gt;. Another first! Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can an algorithm identify these areas? Hoooooow?
Ladies and gents (and robots), let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift"&gt;MeanShift&lt;/a&gt;, an unsupervised algorithm that is used mostly for image recognition and is pretty trivial to setup and run (but also very slow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that this algorithm will let me partition my data (forex ticks) into areas and then I can use the "edges" as support and resistance lines. Cool idea but does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: &lt;strong&gt;It works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      });


    }})}})});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/ &gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyse around &lt;strong&gt;12 million&lt;/strong&gt; datapoints of EURUSD in 2014 and a couple of months of 2015. The resistance lines are placed automagically by a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really cool (and spooky) is that the algorithm pretty much nails it. &lt;strong&gt;NAILS&lt;/strong&gt; it hard. It gets really spooky when we are going to use the algorithm to identify micro-structures and start scalping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is able to process any kind of timeseries data (stocks, forex, gold, whatever) and it  will render an html interactive chart (like the chart above) with your data and the machine generated S/L. The code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's step through the code.
After you have your set of data you need to read them and clean them. Prepare for some &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read csv files with daily data per tick
df = pandas.read_csv(filename, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0, names=[&amp;#39;Date_Time&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Buy&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;],
                     date_parser=lambda x: pandas.to_datetime(x, format=&amp;quot;%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S&amp;quot;))

# group by day and drop NA values (usually weekends)
grouped_data = df.dropna()
ticks_data = grouped_data[&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;].resample(&amp;#39;24H&amp;#39;).ohlc()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drop the empty values (weekends) and then we resample the data to 24 hours candlesticks (ohcl). This makes it MUCH easier to plot. The grouped_data are the data that we will feed into the ml algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we prepare the data that we are going to use in the algo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# use &amp;#39;ask&amp;#39;
sell_data = grouped_data.as_matrix(columns=[&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;])

# calculate bandwidth (expirement with quantile and samples)
bandwidth = estimate_bandwidth(sell_data, quantile=0.1, n_samples=12000000)
ms = MeanShift(bandwidth=bandwidth, bin_seeding=True)

# fit the data
ms.fit(sell_data)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next post, we'll discuss how to make this work even better, discuss some very interesting results (can the algorithm actually predict about the future?) and start using it in our own trading.

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT TAX ADVICE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really surprising is that the majority of the requests in the newsletter are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools to assist Trading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning to optimize trades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two, I can understand. Everybody wants to be a better trader. I get it. But taxes? TAXES? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your lucky day. Forex taxes are super easy. Seriously. By default (this is called &lt;em&gt;Section 988&lt;/em&gt;), all your losses are going to offset your income taxes without the 3k limit per year. This is much better than stock trading where losses offset your capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens to gains? &lt;strong&gt;WHY DO YOU CARE? WHY?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The majority of the Forex traders lose money&lt;/a&gt; (I call it "paying tuition") the first year(s), so you are better off keeping it simple until you have a proven and consistent strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if you actually make a profit, you are taxed at the short-term capital gain (sometimes up to 40%).
The solutions to when you start making money are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opting out of Section 988 and get taxed under Section 1256 where 60% of profits are taxed as long term capital gains and 40% as short term (but now losses cannot offset your income). This is very good when you make money, very bad when you don't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an LLC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people that just started experimenting with Forex and algotrading, I always suggest them to stay with Section 988 (the default) and when they start making some money (consistently) or they want to go full time, talk to me :) Seriously, there are so many things that you will start doing differently when you go from the "hobby" stage to "second income" to "full-time job" that there is no reason to over-optimize this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we talked about &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The "for-looper" backtester&lt;/a&gt; (as I love to call them). Now it's time to see some code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said that we have something like that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we talked about &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The "for-looper" backtester&lt;/a&gt; (as I love to call them). Now it's time to see some code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said that we have something like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::python
    for each element of readhistoricaldata(): 
        apply_strategy() 
        how_our_strategy_did()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, let's load our strategy, load some &lt;a href="downloading-historical-forex-tick-data-and-importing-them-in-to-python-using-pandas.html"&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; data, run our algorithm and print some results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/72428f085a41ddf85259.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to have my strategies in a JSON format that contains the name of the strategy and some specs (like how many pips for stop_loss or take_profit etc). That way, when we'll start using an event-based backtester, we can pass the strategy through a machine learning algorithm and try to optimize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next line is loading our data in. I know people don't like pickle and there other ways to load data (and we are going to talk about BColz at some point) but for now, just bare with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next line is self-explanatory. We pass the historical data to our algo and we get back some stats to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's focus on the algorithm a little bit and we can discuss plotting etc at a later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The magic of the simple backtesting system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare to be amazed by how ridiculously easy to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/7792e71e9079f75ce9a5.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short comings&lt;/em&gt;
What happens with this type of backtesting is that 
1. &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;you'll probably make mistakes when you want to using the exact same algorithm&lt;/a&gt;
2. You won't be able to write a very complex strategy (at least that easy)
3. Very difficult to scale (compared to event-based)
4. You need to have your simulation and execution in the same language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT remember that this is the BEST and fastest way to start out and figure out how all these things work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, using other well-known backtesters in Python and adding graphs to our own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is that as we keep diving more and more into our algotrading system, I will show you how to code and deploy these strategies. I know for sure that most of them work with minimal changes. Worst case scenario, you'll have a system to test out your assumptions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a backtest system is actually pretty easy. Easy to screw up I mean. Even though there are tons of excellent libraries out there (and we'll go through them at some point), I always like doing this on my own in order to fine-tune it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all the backtesting systems I have seen, we can assume that there are two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "for-loopers"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Event generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we'll talk about for-loopers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "for-loopers" are my favorite type of backtesters. They are trivial to write and super fun to expand but they have some vital flows and sadly the majority of backtesters out there is "for-loopers" (ps: I need to find a better name for this!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How for-loopers work? Using a for loop (as you might have guessed). It is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;readhistoricaldata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;apply_strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;how_our_strategy_did&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very simple right? This is how one backtesting system works, that runs a momentum strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/125cbca28067f0aefb2c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the problem? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very difficult to scale (horizontally) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs lots of work to keep your apply_strategy() working on backtesting and production &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to have everything in the same programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into these, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalability&lt;/em&gt;. 
I was experimenting a couple a weeks ago with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing"&gt;hill-climbing&lt;/a&gt; algorithm to optimize one of my strategies. It is still running. After two weeks. And I build uber-scalable systems for a living.
Why is it still running? You can use &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://discoproject.org/"&gt;Disco&lt;/a&gt;, producer/consumer (using &lt;a href="http://zeromq.org/"&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/a&gt;) or just threads to speed this up but some problems are not "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel"&gt;embarrassing parallel&lt;/a&gt;" (yes, this is an actual term, not one of my made-up words). The amount of work to scale a backtester like this (especially when you want to do same machine learning on top of it) is huge. You can do it but it is the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production and backtesting in sync&lt;/em&gt;
This. The times I have been bitten by this. I can recall the lost trades where I was "hm, why I entered this trade?" or my old time favorite "WHY TRAILING STOP WAS APPLIED NOW?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story time: I had an idea in order to optimize my strategy, to run a backtester to see what would happen if I could put a trailing stop AFTER the trade was profitable in order to always secure profits. Backtesting worked like a charm at a 13% increase of earnings and &lt;em&gt;production lost every single trade&lt;/em&gt;. I figured it out after my algo lost $3400 in a couple of hours (a very expensive lesson).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the apply_strategy in sync is very difficult and becomes almost impossible when you want to do it in a distributed fashion. And you don't want to have two version of your strategy that are "almost" identical. Unless you have $3400 to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using different languages&lt;/em&gt;
I love Python. And Erlang. And Clojure. And J. And C. And R. And Ruby (no actually I hate Ruby). I want to be able to leverage the strength of other languages in my system. I want to try out strategies in R where there are very well-tested libraries and there is a huge community behind it. I want to have Erlang to scale my code and C to crunch data. If you want to be succesful (not only in trading), you need to be able to use all the available resources without prejudices. I have learnt tons of stuff from hanging out with R developers regarding how you can delta hedge bonds and visualize them or why Sharpe ratio can be a lie. Every language has a different crowd and you want as many people pouring ideas into your system.
If you try to have apply_strategy in different language then good luck with (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you convinced now? Well, I am not trying to convince you as for-loopers is a great way to run your initial tests. It is how I started and for many strategies I don't send them down to the pipeline. A "better" way (so you can sleep at night) is the event generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, sharing and discussing my simplest (but most successful) backtester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before running any live algotrading system, it is a good practice to backtest (that means run a simulation) our algorithms. Have in mind that this doesn't mean that if your system is killing it for the last 5 years/months/days it will make a profit but it is a good indicator that you might be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four things that we need to take into consideration when we do our backtesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quality of the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to load them efficiently &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to built our backtesting system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to have our backtesting and our live system share as much code as we can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to focus on (1) and (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Forex data, I am using &lt;a href="http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/"&gt;GainCapital&lt;/a&gt;. Their data are in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tick.asp"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt;. For a free source it is good enough. I used to use Oanda's historical data service but it seems that they moved it to a premium product. Too bad. Make sure that you use GainCapital's data only for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any other kind of paid historical data (ETFs, stocks, options stc), I am using &lt;a href="http://eoddata.com/"&gt;eoddata.com&lt;/a&gt; (they also have some forex historical data but I haven't used them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's download data for a week and experiment a little bit.
The link to the data is &lt;a href="http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/2015/11%20November/EUR_USD_Week1.zip"&gt;http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/2015/11%20November/EUR_USD_Week1.zip&lt;/a&gt; for the first week of November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to unzip the file
    :::python
    &amp;gt;unzip EUR_USD_Week1.zip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you'll get a &lt;em&gt;25MB&lt;/em&gt; file named EUR_USD_Week1.csv. These are data for one week for one currency pair. You can imagine the amount of data you need to process for all currencies for the last five years (hint: a lot!). But don't worry, we are going optimize this. For now, let's open the file and inspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EUR_USD_Week1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;lTid&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;cDealable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CurrencyPair&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateDateTime&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateBid&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateAsk&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650058&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:06.490000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103380&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103770&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650061&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:06.740000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103760&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650072&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:07.990000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103390&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650083&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:08.990000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the things that we care about is the RateDateTime, RateBid and RateAsk. As you can understade each line has a timestamp and the how much was the price to buy or sell. Formats downloaded by other services are pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to load these data into Python but the most preferable when it comes to data slicing and manipulating is using &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;.
We can always use the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html"&gt;csv&lt;/a&gt; library to load data (and it might be faster) but we need to do some optimizations and processing first that as you will see it is pretty easy with pandas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great tool to load TONS of GBs pretty efficiently and very fast is using &lt;a href="http://bcolz.blosc.org/"&gt;Bcolz&lt;/a&gt;, covered in a much later post (or you can read a preview if you have signed up in the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating data using Pandas&lt;/em&gt;
The data we downloaded are in ticks. Unless we are building an UHFT (ultra high frequency trading) algorithm, it is much more efficient (memory, storage and processing-wise) to
"group" these ticks into seconds (or minutes or hours depending on your strategy). This will make our download scale down from 25MB to just &lt;em&gt;35KB&lt;/em&gt; which translate to HUGE performance and memory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's group all these data in 15 minutes. How? Time to fall in love with resample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parse_dates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index_col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Tid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Dealable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Pair&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Buy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# let&amp;#39;s erase the columns we don&amp;#39;t need&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Tid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Dealable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Pair&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# group every 15 minutes and create an OHLC bar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;grouped_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;15Min&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ohlc&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resampled the dataset looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| DateTime            | Buy | Open | Buy | High | Buy | Low | Buy | Close | Sell | Open | Sell | High | Sell | Low | Sell | Close |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2015-08-02 17:00:00 | 1.09706    | 1.09821    | 1.09706   | 1.09735     | 1.09752     | 1.09853     | 1.09740    | 1.09762      |
| 2015-08-02 17:15:00 | 1.09731    | 1.09825    | 1.09731   | 1.09769     | 1.09762     | 1.09843     | 1.09758    | 1.09808      |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called OHLC (Open High Low Close) bar for every &lt;em&gt;15 minutes&lt;/em&gt;. You can see now that the ticks are grouped in 15 minute segments and you have the highest and lowest point that the price reached during these 15 minutes and also the open/close for buy and sell. Pure gold! Not only you have all the information you need but now it is extremely fast to load it. You just need to save the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# save to file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;grouped_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_pickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-OHLC.pkl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then you can reuse this 35kb file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can write a simple momentum algorithm that checks if there was a huge movement the last 15 minutes and if that was the case, let's buy. We will dive into this in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the code as always on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading/blob/master/post4/create_OHLC.py"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before building any algotrading systems, you need to know how to trade manually. What that actually means is that you need to lose money on your own before blaming the machine. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about Foreign Exchange or Forex as the cool guys call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why do we choose Forex for algotrading? Why don't we become millionaires trading like everybody else? Why not just buy Tesla, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter and hope for the best (PS: please read the legal outro at the end of this blog post before buying any stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy answer. You cannot win (or lose) money fast enough by buying stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex has a nice (or terrible, depending on which side of the coin you are) thing called &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage can be 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:1000 depending on how suicidal you are or how sketchy your broker is (don't worry, we'll talk about brokers in the next post). Let's see an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to place a trade of $1k. The logical thing is that in order to buy something that costs $1k, you need to have in your account $1k, right? Nope. You can always get a loan. Oooooooor: Enter leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a 1:100 leverage, we can place a trade and "control" $1k with just $10. For those that failed at math (don't be ashamed, I am one of you), $10 x 100 (leverage) = $1,000.
That means you can trade big and win big! Actually 100 times more &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;! The catch is that you can actually go 100 times more &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;. Let's have another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got my bonus ($1k) and I want to play on Forex.
Without any leverage, I can buy 1,000 Forex units that cost $1 (by the way, there are no Forex units but we'll talk about this later). 
How many units can I buy with 1:50 leverage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answer if 100,000, you did something wrong. The answer is 50,000 ($1,000 x 50 leverage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. One of the reasons that we are doing Forex, is because you can &lt;a href="http://jon.io/building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;lose&lt;/a&gt;/win big. We'll get back to leverage when we start placing trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three more exciting reasons actually that are even more awesome (dare to say awesomer?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forex (almost) never sleeps. The markets are open ALL DAY, six days per week. To be more exact, there is not one market but four and they are overlapping providing the "all day" effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forex is very volatile and there are tons of money moving around (more than 5 trillion &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;). Crazy right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No fees on trades. You don't pay $10 per trade like you are doing with stocks. Here you pay &lt;em&gt;the spread&lt;/em&gt; which is just a fraction of a cent (again, we'll talk about this in another post).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these reasons (leverage, all-day, volatility, fees) make Forex the most exciting platform to build and deploy your algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, Forex brokers. How not to be scammed before even writing a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal outro. This is an engineering tutorial on how to build an algotrading platform for experimentation and FUN. Any suggestions here are not financial advices. 
If you lose any (or all) you money because you followed any trading advices or deployed this system in production, you cannot blame this random blog (and/or me).

&lt;p&gt;So, I am planning to cover the basics of how to build your own trading platform, write your own strategies and go on vacations while electrons are making you money. Or zeroing your account. Either way, it is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the examples are going to be in Python even though there might be parts in Erlang and I'll try to keep it as easy as it can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about what the final product will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a system where you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate your strategy (this is called &lt;a href="http://jon.io/building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;backtesting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute your strategy without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alert you via sms/email for trades and errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be scalable and trivial to deploy new updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to run even from your home (from a raspberrypi for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume this is going to be a total of 20 chapters, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a system similar to the one that I am running the last year and includes a UI, sms alerts, backtesting pipeline, continuous delivery and all the cool stuff that us geeks love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code will be on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and if everything goes well, I'll wrap it up in a book for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have like three chapters almost done, so if you want early access just ping me at - &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;jonromero&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="trading"></category><category term="algotrading"></category></entry><entry><title>How to build your own algorithmic trading platform</title><link href="http://jon.io/how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-28T22:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2022-06-16T11:08:25-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;Here is a scenario:
I have lots of data sitting as CSV on my hard-drive and I want to process them. Not query them. Process them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be really interesting is to be able to define (dynamically) a schema like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;defschema&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;EURUSD&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tokenizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; the mapping is done here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|time|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|open|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|high|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|low|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|close|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|volume|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.
First of all, a "tokenize" function. Each dataline is tokenized based on a function. Do you want regex? Something more complex? You are free to write anything you like. I really hate frameworks that you must write a complex regular expression or use a compicated system just to tokenize a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, tokenize returns a list of data that are mapped to "columns".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the interesting stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write scripts like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|close|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;place-order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:buy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;place-order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;:sell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has enormous amount of data (volume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These data are coming extremely fast (velocity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to consider multiple resources when you are building your strategy (variety)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My definition of BigData is that you have volume-velocity-variety information &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; you need to react on it right now (realtime). It is one of the main reasons why I don't like Hadoop (ok, the other is because I don't like Java:). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex is the best place if you want to start playing with BigData. You have (at least) one data channel, hitting you with data, you need to keep running algorithms on this stream (sometimes doing correlations up to a week) and you need be able to respond very fast. If a garbage collector kicks in or if you need to grab data from a database (even if this DB is in memory - long live Redis) then you will have issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the reason why most of the "trading" databases have all their data in the same memory space and have custom languages doing the analysis (like &lt;a href="http://kx.com"&gt;Kdb&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the inspiration for LDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of data sources (mobile phones), hitting your database and calculating/updating for each one of the requests thousands of counters and running all sorts of algorithms. Per request. In realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's face it. The vast majority of users/companies will never have millions (or even thousands) of requests hitting their servers. That's why I started a new opensource database with codename: HybrisDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HDB has the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to install (no moving parts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to use (pre-defined dashboards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will be perfect for the 99% of users/companies but not for the 1% like Facebook or Google (sacrificing Enterprise features)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is to have a dashboard, to watch indicators going on/off and then (maybe) connect to a system to place an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an interesting cool hobby project and I still try to decide between using Erlang or Clojure for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ping me on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
