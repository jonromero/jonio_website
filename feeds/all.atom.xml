&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathwork is breathing with intention in order to provoke physical or mental changes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out very fast that the majority of people have no idea what a superpower breathing can be.
And of course that we are breathing fundamentaly wrong (hint: you should breathe &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can breathing make you stressed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know to "take a deep breath to relax" or to "take a deep breath, this is going to hurt" and we assumed that breathing more air makes things &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;. Newsflash: It is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever had a panic attack (or seen a movie where someone was super stressed), you might know about the paper bag trick. The trick is that when you are stressed, breathe in and out inside a small paper bag. How this works is that you are breathing CO2 instead of oxygen. When we are stressed, &lt;strong&gt;we breathe&lt;/strong&gt; more oxygen (and we hyperventilate) and our CO2 blood levels go down. And this is bad. Surprisingly, our brain freaks out A TON when CO2 levels are low. Our brain also freaks out when CO2 levels are high (lack of oxygen) but this is something that we can learn to control (up to a level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I need high CO2 in my blood? CO2 is bad!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO2 and oxygen are in a balance in your bloodstream. This balance is disrupted when you are inhaling tons of oxygen. Of course there are cases where this disruption leads to an improved system and we'll get there. But messing up with the balance without intention is a recipe for disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first symptoms is starting to feel light headed, jittery and panicky. In order to increase your CO2, there are a couple of ways. One is to breathe more CO2 from a paper bag (inhale and exhale in the paper bag). The other is to &lt;strong&gt;stop breathing&lt;/strong&gt;. And before you start passing out from holding your breath, let me explain how we should increase our CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is CO2 good for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is awesome. If you hold your breath right now, you will last (before gasping for air) 1 or 2 minutes (the world record is around 24 minutes). For me, that is a very strange fact. Why the most important thing for our survival is not stored? Why I store fat the moment I eat some chocolate but I cannot store oxygen? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen is being used to create energy by providing the "fire" to "burn" nutrients . Storing tons of "fire" can be 
problematic as fire has a tendancy to spread. Uncontroliably. 
The conversion to energy is happening in mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. These little guys are responsible for producing the energy that we need (if you want to get technical, they produce ATP) and they are using oxygen in this process. At another post we'll talk about why you should be taking Coq10 to increase your ATP production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you pump your system with too much oxygen all day long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Firestarter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By overusing your mitochondria, you start creating inflamation in your body (you create free radicals). Inflamation can be good if it is controlled (like when you go to gym, you pump iron and then your muscles recover and you get stronger) but if it happens all the time is bad. Very bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, your mitochondria are not working very efficiently. They create energy that is not used as it supposed to.
This has been linked to a lot of illnesses like diabetes, cancer and Alzheimer's just to name a few. Your mitochondria need to be trained. And the way to train them is by restricting their oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting high on your own supply&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was training for my pilots' license, I was told about hypoxia - the phenomenon of not having enough oxygen. 
It happens when you are over 20000 feet and you can check (this video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_MI9UiYwJA] to see that it is hilarious (when you are on the ground). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia is deadly when you are flying a plane because you feel ephoric as your brain start hallucinating and you have
no idea that you are in danger. You are just very very happy (happy hormones such as serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, noradrenaline are released when CO2 levels are high). And this happens because there is lack of oxygen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Soooo, now oxygen is good?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you increase for &lt;strong&gt;a bit&lt;/strong&gt; your CO2 levels, you are putting your body under stress. 
Like going to the gym and you exercise. When the exercise is over the balance is restored, your body has improved. Your mitochondria are operating a bit more efficiently, the inflammation has gone down and the temporary inflamation created has actually attacked any possible diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By increasing &lt;strong&gt;mindfully&lt;/strong&gt; your oxygen levels, you make your blood alkaline (you increase it's pH) and my increasing your CO2 levels, you make it acidic. This switch, makes your autonomous nervous system to rebalance and leads to reduced stress, anxiety and increased performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing your CO2 levels (as we said you learn to increase them), you can increase your athletic performance. This is due to the fact that you increase production of ATP. As an example is using the Wim Hof breathing, you can perform a lot more push ups than you actually can &lt;strong&gt;while you hold your breath&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Damn this is interesting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it is not even the beginning! Wait until we talk about what happens when you dive in cold water and stay there for a long time and your prehistoric brain turns on and starts protecting you. Or how by not breathing you can have increased physical performance. Or how you can convert fat to "brown fat" that is used faster for energy. Or why breathing through your mouth can mess up your HRV (heart rate variability).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next posts, we'll cover topics like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to unblock your nose in 1 minute by alternating your breathing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to hold your breath for 2 minutes with less than 1 minute practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you can improve your immune system with breathing exercises (and tons of scientific research)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And six different breathworks for relaxation (Wim Hof, Holotropic, Buteyko etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why breathing from your mouth changes the structure of your whole face&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And tons of more cool factoids&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to formalize this by doing a yearly &lt;em&gt;"Jon V"&lt;/em&gt; conference where I meet my favorite, super smart Entrepreneurs and do a deep dive into technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing how the US is a bit "ahead" in terms of technology and blockchain adoption, I decided to run a &lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; conference and talk about NFTs, smart contracts, DAOs and Startups from inception, to development to productization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about the agenda. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Agenda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original plan was simple: Get a huge airbnb, invite some people that want to learn and let's have a hackathon. But I think we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"V as in MetaVerse"&lt;/strong&gt; will take place sometime in the beginning of July in Greece. Maybe Athens? Maybe Kalamata? Maybe somewhere else? It all depends on the location I can find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tickets for the event will be &lt;strong&gt;NFTs&lt;/strong&gt;. A limited edition of NFTs will be given for &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; to volunteers, speakers and people that don't have the financial means to attend. The rest of the tickets/NFTs will be available at various prices ($10-$50). The reason there is a price, is because I want to weed out people that are not committed in coming and learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event will be three days. Day one, is presentations and workshops about blockchain development, NFTs, branding, fund raising, Startups and anything else we can fit in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day two, is the hackathon and some networking events. You have 24 hours to build a kick ass blockchain project based on a theme to be announced. The first three teams will get a price from our sponsors.
 
Day three, in the morning, we select the winners and that's a wrap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of course will be available online a couple of weeks after the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is that it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ha, of course not! There is a surprise in all this. A &lt;strong&gt;hidden&lt;/strong&gt; project that hopefully will be approved by the Greek government as it requires their permission and takes 5 to 10 years to complete. Let's just say for now, that the space where the event with take place, will be a "Metaverse blackhole". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sounds awesome. How can I help?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking for speakers, people to help, sponsors, media sponsors and in general cool people :) If you are one of them or you can suggest someone, join the &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/XvCttdjTAM"&gt;Discord Server&lt;/a&gt;. There is a room to coordinate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super excited and super stressed but it is going to be awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If you bought &lt;a href="my-birthday-cake-as-an-nft"&gt;one of my NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, talk to me on Discord because you get a free ticket :D&lt;/p&gt;

They have this epic NFT, pixelated and animated by me, stored in the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and on IPFS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="First edition" src="/images/jonscake.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/piece-of-cake_v2s1Oc8vg1/"&gt;second edition&lt;/a&gt; costs &lt;strong&gt;Ξ 0.1&lt;/strong&gt; (UPDATE: it is sold out!), there are only 40 copies and has &lt;strong&gt;unlockable content&lt;/strong&gt;. The content is a numbered acrylic art block that contains the NFT and I will ship it wherever you live. For free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you didn't understand, this NFT comes also with a physical product, send to your place for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Unlockable content" src="/images/gift.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This NFT release pushed me to work more on our brand new infrastructure at &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com"&gt;OMGDrops&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some more geeky details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Piece of cake" is running on the brand new Decentralized App (DApp) of OMGDrops and IPFS. It is 100% decentralized running on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After you buy the NFT, it is immediately available AT NO COST at OpenSea. You can trade it there and make some sweet ETH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The limited Edition NFT has unlockable content that is uses your wallet signature to unlock it and off-the-chain authentication. I am planning to open source this part because I haven't found anywhere how to do this at scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is built on Python/Flask, TailwindCSS and Solidity 0.8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops is still a hybrid. Some of our creators are not on the website, others are but we linked them on OpenSea or Rarible and some of them are 100% on the blockchain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops will become a fully Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) by the end of 2021.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OMGDrops DApp can be integrated with other websites &lt;strong&gt;with just one line of code&lt;/strong&gt;, helping artists sell their NFTs directly from their websites. How epic is that!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in beta testing, sending me an email and we'll get you started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More technical details coming at a later post, so sign up to stay in the loop or drop by my &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/gEnk5f4web"&gt;Discord channel&lt;/a&gt;. Oh and don't forget to &lt;a href="https://omgdrops.com/jonv/pieceofcake_limited/"&gt;buy the NFT&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2021 I …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If a year ago someone told me that they bought an image, a simple file that is trivial to download for &lt;strong&gt;$1500&lt;/strong&gt;, I would think that they are idiots. But as it happens with all new opportunities, the line between idiots and informed investors is blurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2021 I decided to dance on that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blockchain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a huge supporter of the blockchain technology mostly because I am a huge geek. Surprisingly &lt;a href="https://jon.io/trading-ethereum-making-10-every-20-minutes"&gt;this worked really well for me&lt;/a&gt; at a time where Ethereum was $8-$12 (now it is $1500-$2000). I kept following very closely all the new trends and trying to figure out what is &lt;strong&gt;"the next big thing"&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are following the crypto space (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Doge etc) you know that every week there is a new "next big thing". Finding whether this is an unstoppable Tsunami or not is how fortunes are made. Or lost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real metric that works is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do people use it RIGHT now?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't care if it is great on paper, if the price is high or if Elon Musk is pushing it. Do people &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; use it? Is there a &lt;strong&gt;community&lt;/strong&gt; around it building software and new tools? &lt;strong&gt;Is there a future&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;NFT: Non-fungible tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs are the newest hype. Millions of dollars in transactions and to tell you the truth, I love how they disrupted the art gallery space. Anyone can buy and sell art while sitting at home, drinking kombucha and watching Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to get what NFTs are is to understand that they represent ownership. An NFT is used mostly for digital items but there are tons of others of use cases that I'll explore in another post. Let's see an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an artist and I digitize my work (I take a photo) and I upload it to one of the current trading platforms for NFTs (like &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/"&gt;Opensea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://rarible.com/"&gt;Rarible&lt;/a&gt;). The process of converting my art to NFT is called minting and during that extremely simple process I can also add some properties to my NFT (we call them metadata). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example this is an NFT that just got sold $215k as I was writing this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/punk.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has some properties (Accessories and Type) and it is unique, meaning that whoever bought this, is the unique owner of this image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait? Why is it unique? I can download it for free&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the argument that I keep hearing about NFTs. Why would I buy it if I can get it for free? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all comes down to &lt;strong&gt;perceived&lt;/strong&gt; value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are literally thousands of copies of Mona Lisa. But only the original one can capture all the value. NFTs are on the blockchain so you can always know whether this is the original or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But I cannot have it on my wall and enjoy it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't have my Tesla stocks on the wall. And (sadly) the vast amount of expensive art is locked up inside vaults and sometimes even at the museums you don't see the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art can  be enjoyed and also be traded for money. You can have a piece of art that is not enjoyable but worth millions of dollars and art that is a masterpiece but worth less than a doge coin ($0.005). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFTs create new, efficient and fast marketplaces for anyone to upload their art, purchase, speculate and invest in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How big is the NFT space right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been buying and selling since 2018 (the &lt;a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/"&gt;Cryptokitties&lt;/a&gt; days) but now it is out of control. We are talking about buying something for $50 and selling it for $30k in less than a month. The NBA started &lt;a href="https://www.nbatopshot.com/"&gt;their own NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, celebrities are &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/03/grimes-art-sold-nft-cryptocurrency-auction-elon-musk-warnymph"&gt;printing money&lt;/a&gt; and more and more and &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-enjin-bring-cross-platform-custom-nfts-to-minecraft-2021-02-11"&gt;more companies&lt;/a&gt; jump into the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, a myriad of companies are building tools and making sure everything is faster, cheaper and more accessible for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Should I spend all my money buying NFTs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT market is very volatile and moves extremely fast. It is the definition of FOMO and hypecoaster (hype going on a rollercoaster). Read as much as you can, research the hell out of it and understand that whenever you think it is a smart investment, it probably is a stupid one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hey, you didn't tell me the story of how you made 50%&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes! I hate clickbaiting so here is the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/hash.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, use a new wallet for any big transcations that you are planning to do. If you don't know the reasons then you probably haven't done any big transactions so you are ok for now (hint: security).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, join as many discord channels as you can and read about the company that has issued that NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the NFT stored on &lt;a href="https://www.ipfs.com/"&gt;IPFS&lt;/a&gt;? Is the NFT using a non-audited smart contract? Is the NFT &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-market-top-signal-fake-banksy-nets-over-1-million-in-eth-sales"&gt;actually real&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your due-diligence is legit then you have to assess whether this is a speculation game or a long term investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal with Hashmasks was to buy as many &lt;strong&gt;entry levels&lt;/strong&gt; Hashmasks as I could (the cost was 1-2 ETH etc) and keep them for 2-3 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the average price started going up (by 50% to 4x), the same thing happened to my hashmasks. I was getting offers without having my mask on sale - a sign that the market is super hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFT is a brand new space and every investor should know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 was a very strange year for all of us. A year where we had to reinvent ourselves and slow down. Slow down to think, slow down to reprioritize. Slow down to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was a …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 was a very strange year for all of us. A year where we had to reinvent ourselves and slow down. Slow down to think, slow down to reprioritize. Slow down to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me it was a year I learnt a lot about me and what fuels me for a 10x performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learnt how to shoot my own videos (poorly), edit them (poorly-times-2), build better financial models for &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;AgentRisk&lt;/a&gt;, built products (that make money) faster and how to build a bigger audience that matters &lt;strong&gt;to me&lt;/strong&gt;. I even had a freaking 1 hour interview with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrES48wX6CQ"&gt;Ice-T&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad(?) thing is that I acquired some skills that I DEFINITELY didn't want. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I posted an article about how to &lt;a href="the-joy-journal"&gt;find the things that you love&lt;/a&gt;. This year I collected more metrics and I came closer to the things that make my day better. Maybe some of these findings can be applied to your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lords of Summer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood_of_the_month.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that I moved to Los Angeles is because it is summer all year long. I love &lt;a href="addictive-design-using-unpredictable-rewards"&gt;the sport of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; but this summer I was also involved in a &lt;a href="how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country"&gt;huge humanitarian project&lt;/a&gt; where I architected and coded a whole system from scratch.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I freaking loved it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really missed writing code and building products that &lt;strong&gt;just work&lt;/strong&gt; instead of making sure I don't upset the SEC. Yes, having your own wealth management company and managing millions using algorithms might sound exciting but after a while it is soul crushing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that put me in an interesting situation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being the CEO of the best Wealth Management company in the planet is an amazing ego booster. It is a social status that is higher than "a guy writing code and building stuff".  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it seems that it just is "not fun" for me. I definitely plan to fix this this year by "making investing fun again". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly regulated areas that you cannot innovate fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;only wealthy people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weekend Warriors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood_of_the_week.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mood this year was way better than last year (this is also attributed that I am a positive person in general and to my support network - I love you all btw) but there is a distinguishable uptick on Saturdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturdays are my "project" days. The days where I get to build small experiments to try ideas. Experiments that I have zero expectations that will ever get any traction but I've seen a couple of them getting a couple of thousand of followers. This blog is also one of these experiments by the way. It is also the days where I meet with friends and we barbecue in the backyard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fridays were my "meeting" days. I used to pack all my meetings on a Friday. Now I dedicate 3 hours *&lt;em&gt;per week&lt;/em&gt; in meetings that I won't learn something new or have an insane fun time. I plan to bring this down to 30 minutes per week by outsourcing everything to my (kickass) EA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No expectation experiments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spending more time with friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meetings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mood" src="/images/mood.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I started focusing more on "life design" (I'll post more about &lt;strong&gt;life design&lt;/strong&gt; in the following weeks). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life design helps you build your day, week, month and year in a way that creates a perfect flow for you. It usually requires you to reprioritize your whole belief system but the main gist is if you are not ecstatic about something, you shouldn't do it. This new navigational framework is making ripples on the rest of my life as old milestones (like raising money for my company or even selling it) become swamps that will slow you down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core lies in finding the things that you are madly in love with and center your life around them while avoiding the things that you hate. Definitively not as easy as it sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It needs you to be true to yourself, crash your ego and reevaluate your whole day/week/month/year/life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of these things that starts as a whisper and ends up as a roar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone sends you an email for a meeting. You are "so and so" but because you are polite, you respond and have the 30m meeting that goes nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;definitely not&lt;/strong&gt; a HELL YEAH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, I am not checking email (sometimes for a week) and then on new emails if it is not a &lt;strong&gt;hell yeah&lt;/strong&gt;, I might not even respond. I know, it sounds like an asshole move and I ALWAYS tried to respond to everyone in the past but this is not aligned with my current life design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guard your time and &lt;a href="https://jon.io/3-tricks-to-smash-your-goals"&gt;control your calendar else someone else will control your life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope I convinced you to spend at least 10 minutes and write down the things that you love and the things that you hate. It is the only step to become better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Best way to measure real KPIs?

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am building a course for Founders and I am coding my own platform for it (it's a long story) and the simplest way to see if the content is interesting was to start a &lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail"&gt;simple newsletter course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first couple of days, I got more than 100 founders going through the course but I wanted to see how many of them are really interested about the full course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the last email where I talked about the course, I &lt;strong&gt;DIDN'T ADD THE LINK&lt;/strong&gt; to the full course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this happened:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f2.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f3.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f7.png"&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/f8.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 founders sent me an email like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30 people that are interested in the course &lt;strong&gt;that much&lt;/strong&gt; to send me an email (or ping me on social media).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many people will click to check out the website shouldn't matter when you are trying to validate a product. 
You should be interested in how many people really want to connect with you and ask more questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there you have it. Force your users to really ask about your product

Your mission is to destroy Germany's ability to wage war and free up the skies for the Allied Forces. The problem is that your Bombers are being zapped out of the sky like mosquitos drawn into the fire in a summery night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German anti-aircraft fire and Luftwaffe  - the German Air Force - are making your life hard. You cannot afford losing more Bombers and more personnel else the war is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to most problems is data. Data is also the culprit of most problems but that is a different post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the WWII, the United States after suffering terrible losses turn to Statistical Research Group (SRG) that had the best statisticians in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/plane.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombers had to be reinforced with metal in order to cover any weak points. Sadly, you cannot cover the whole plane with additional metal as metal is heavy. The weakest points had to be identified and only these points had to be patched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collection started with analyzing the location of the bullet holes that were found on the Bombers that made it back safely. The obvious idea was to patch the areas that had the highest concentration of bullet holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More bullet holes around the wings? Patch that part. More bullet holes around the tail? Patch the tail. Data driven decisions at its best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for the missing bullets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one critical issue with that theory: The US collected data from the planes that made it back, the planes that survived and obviously weren't blown out of the sky. If anything, they should have been looking to patch &lt;strong&gt;the areas that had no bullet holes at all&lt;/strong&gt;. The planes that went down were never included in the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abraham Wald from SRG suggested, the  bombers were going down because they were shot &lt;strong&gt;at&lt;/strong&gt; the engines - an area that had zero bullet holes on the returning planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making assumptions based on a winning, surviving dataset is called &lt;strong&gt;Survivorship Bias&lt;/strong&gt; and it can be devastating for Entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking for missing opportunities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to idolize the person that worked for 5 years in a bad idea but at the end made it and now is a multimillionaire. Or the Entrepreneur that left a well paying job and decided to build a new company and now he has more money than the budget of a small European city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Entrepreneurs, we learn to listen to the data but what happens when our whole dataset is made up from "planes that survived"? What happens when only 1% of bombers make it back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing the blind spots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have blind spots. Every single one of us. We become better by making these spots as small as we can. We do that by stepping back and looking at the big picture instead of getting closer and closer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From up close, even a dot seems like a huge black hole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step in finding what "brings us down" is start looking for what might be missing. A good example is customer reviews. 
Relying &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; on customer reviews is a terrible idea to improve your business. I know a Startup that had brilliant reviews but was bleeding customers. The majority of these customers never cared to provide any feedback - they just hated the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same happens when you ask  for opinions from your friends or family. Even if they are hard on you, it is no comparison with the feedback you will get from strangers that don't care about your feelings. I am not saying that "all feedback is good", you still have to filter it but at least collect as much as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you like getting blown out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category><category term="popular"></category></entry><entry><title>How I spent my summer, helping to save a whole country</title><link href="http://jon.io/how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-10T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

It was kind of a cheap shot as “huge secret project” are my trigger words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked me if I can join him on a Zoom at 6am. I told him that I am not going to wake up that early even if the President of Greece was on that Zoom call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the Prime Minister and his team of scientists were on the call and I was there, 7am in Los Angeles, half awake, wearing my “A.I pays my bills” t-shirt. The “huge secret project” was not clickbait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are going to build something that has never been built before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know Greece, I assume it is because you hate good food, sunshine, breathtaking beaches, history, and you haven’t watched “My Big Greek Fat Wedding”. And this comes from someone that is 100% impartial on this (being Greek doesn’t mean I cannot be impartial, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo by Jonathan Gallegos on Unsplash" src="/images/greece-ml.jpeg"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece has a population of 11 million and during non-COVID19 summers, the country hosts more than &lt;strong&gt;33 million tourists&lt;/strong&gt;. This is &lt;strong&gt;more than 3 times the population of the entire country&lt;/strong&gt;. They all come to Greece and spend most of their time on the (tiny) Greek Islands. Oh, and most of them come &lt;strong&gt;during the three (summer) months&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism also supports nearly a quarter of the country’s jobs and represents 20% of the nation’s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of COVID19, this is a double-edged sword for the country. On one hand, keeping its borders closed to tourists equals &lt;strong&gt;financial suicide&lt;/strong&gt; for Greece — a country that had just started to recover from a previous financial hardship. On the other hand, blindly accepting &lt;strong&gt;100K to 300K tourists PER DAY&lt;/strong&gt;, translates to “Death by COVID19”, by putting the locals at risk of infection. To the best of our knowledge, there is no country that has the capacity to conduct these many tests or this kind of infrastructure or solution to pull this off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Meet EVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is a country-wide AI screening and testing program , thought to be the first of its kind in the world, which has been online since July 1st 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="EVA" src="/images/eva.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you are one of the lucky ones that can work remotely. What better place to work from than the seaside, munching on tasty Mediterranean food. Again, 100% impartial on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before your arrival in Greece, you must fill out an online “passenger locator form” (we call it PLF) providing basic information including which country they are coming from, gender, age, and other details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After submitting your information to the GDPR-compliant system (Europe is extremely careful regarding how personal data is stored and handled), a subset of anonymized data arrives to EVA. EVA takes into account how many other people will arrive at the same entry point, availability of tests, and your personal risk profile and responds with a “TEST” or “NO TEST”. All in realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “test/no-test” information is sent back to you via email and encoded as a QR CODE that will be scanned upon your arrival in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The immigration officer will know at the time of scanning whether you should be sent for testing or you are free to continue your vacations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are sent for testing, your (anonymized) lab results will be fed back to EVA to improve the model and its accuracy — closing the self-learning loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By digitizing the details of a visitor’s trip, Greece can make informed decisions on who should be tested, how tests should be allocated, or whether any borders need to be closed due to increasing risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How good EVA is?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal opinion (using only public data) is that EVA is working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently Greece has less than 20 new external infections from 100k visitors per day. The total infections are on average 150 to 200 mostly to internal spread of the virus which is extremely low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know any other country that managed to stay open for as long as Greece while having thousands of tourists per day and open bars and restaurants. Of course if Greece wants to keep infections low, will have to impose stricter controls to manage “internal infections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA might seem like a “Deus Ex Machina” but as Greeks say&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot expect everything from the Gods — you also have to put some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;TeamEVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EVA is the brain child of three very smart people. And me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamsa-bastani-4a346955/"&gt;Hamsa Bastani&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of operations, information and decisions from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimon-drakopoulos-a5663341/"&gt;Kimon Drakopoulos&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professors of data science and operations at the Marshall School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishal-gupta-usc/"&gt;Vishal Gupta&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professors of data science and operations at the Marshall School&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://jon.io/pages/my-story"&gt;And me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole team is committed in open-sourcing the important parts of EVA and of course a full publication will be coming up in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine introduced me to &lt;a href="https://www.gianlucagimini.it/portfolio-item/velocipedia/?fbclid=IwAR3mtHozjRDKoawWPS6PcYeltg4jvZucLnvuj4RrGkWWeRlVr0fhk5cvZv8"&gt;Velocipedia&lt;/a&gt;, a project where people are asked to draw bicycles from memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Bicycle" src="/images/artbike.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the bicycles drawn have some vital flows. &lt;strong&gt;These bicycles cannot exist&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gianluca Gimini says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little I knew this is actually a test that psychologists use to demonstrate how our brain sometimes tricks us into thinking we know something even though we don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about we do this for building products?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This Product Does Not Exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of months I am building a new platform that teaches you how to build a Startup &lt;strong&gt;fast&lt;/strong&gt; and the number one problem is overthinking about your first version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course the majority of founders are building their prototype without ever talking to at least 10 customers. Crazy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am (obviously) guilty of overthinking too when it comes to product development so I decided to ask 20 users to draw, using only pen and paper, the landing page and one functional page. This could work with just 5 users by the way. This is the message that I've sent them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sent by me" src="/images/sentbyme.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can try it yourself if you want before seeing the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I've learnt from the landing pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/ What &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; like is not what my users like&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/proone.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;90% of the landing pages had a video/teaser which is something &lt;strong&gt;my design didn't have&lt;/strong&gt;. I don't like having videos in landing pages but it seems that for educational content, it is a must.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/protwo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/ Users expect discounts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/prothree.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the designs had a "free week" or "buy now and get X% discount". &lt;strong&gt;I have this too&lt;/strong&gt; (you get most of the chapters for free) but not in that prominent space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/ Testimonials were not such a big theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/profour.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every landing page that had testimonials didn't dedicate a lot of space to them and it was usually on the second page (under the fold). &lt;strong&gt;That was my wrong assumption&lt;/strong&gt;, thinking that I needed to have a good amount of testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4/ Pay attention to interesting ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/profive.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some landing pages that were 100% different from the rest. I am definitely going to integrate some ideas from them. It what makes products different, interesting and fun to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I've learnt from the functional pages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5/ Video is king - but text is his Queen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notes, action lists, descriptions and extra resources. &lt;strong&gt;I HAD NO IDEA&lt;/strong&gt;.
 
Now it makes sense. Users want more material and want to be able to go back and look at their notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/prosix.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6/ Group chat and discussions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Landing" src="/images/proseven.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a much more difficult feature but it seemed important for a lot of users. I would try using Slack/Discord before building something into the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Perfect User Does Not Exist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have built the landing user-generated landing page waaaaaay faster than the one I designed. Making assumptions and believing in them is the worst way to build a Startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn how your users can use your product, eliminate all your biases. Give them a pen and paper and tell them to draw the UI. Focus on the commonality, build fast and have them try it out again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you cannot make everyone happy. The Perfect User Does Not Exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A huge thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goes to everyone who sent me their drawings! You get free access to the course &lt;strong&gt;forever&lt;/strong&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the course, don't forget to sign up to the &lt;a href="/pages/weekly-tips"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now go and make some products that don't exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my life 4 years ago and I can tell you that none of these calls went as I wanted to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 2 years later, $1M raised in a week - mostly uneventfulness. This is not some weird flex as everyone knows that fundraising is a soul-crashing experience, regardless how easy it may seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;People are stupid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have ever discussed with someone about politics, art, music, sports, food, drinks, fashion, science or let’s say &lt;strong&gt;anything on any subject&lt;/strong&gt; then you agree with me (if not, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; are stupid): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are stupid because YOU are right and they cannot see how wrong THEY are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, you cannot always scream "YOU ARE AN IDIOT" to their faces and go on with your day. Sometimes you need to convince them that your argument is solid and theirs it is not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you are trying to raise money for your company and the investors cannot understand that your idea will be more earth shaking than the second coming of Jesus. Or that your political party is the only one that can save the country or why keto diet is the best diet in the world or why Bitcoin is a scam (it is a scam - please don’t argue with me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why people cannot stop being stupid and just agree with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The backfire effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are situations where the evidence are on your side. Literally like “the earth is not flat” kind of evidence, backed by science and backed by anyone else that has IQ over 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, there are people that THEY JUST DON’T get it. &lt;strong&gt;And what do you do?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You argue. You confront them with more and more and more evidence. More data. But they still act irrationally and cannot be convinced regardless the amount of evidence and data they are presented to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the called &lt;strong&gt;the backfire effect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is irrational, any evidence presented to them  is “fake” or irrelevant. Confronting them with more evidence &lt;strong&gt;cements&lt;/strong&gt; their belief because now you are treating them as if they actually have a valid argument and you are trying to debate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current Startup being a Wealth Management company, I have billions of stories to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When insanity knocks on your door&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I manage people’s money for a living. I’ve been also managing my money for a long time. That doesn’t mean that I am the best one out there (hint: I actually am) but I run circles around non-professional investors. Again, not because I am smarter but because I am using data and this is what I do full-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of people I met that have 100% wrong opinion about the market, about stocks, about what to buy and what to sell, &lt;strong&gt;is staggering&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is even more mind-blowing is that it is pretty easy to prove that I am right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My investments make more money than their investments. It is super clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, they cannot be convinced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve met people that lost 30% of their money and they are still convinced that they did better (I am screaming silently, HOW?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The super interesting crazy fact is these exact same people will trust a con salesman and get ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to convince the inconvincible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that you cannot convince everyone. Some people might have their own personal reasons and they will never share them with you. It is exponentially more difficult with people that they &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; they know better and &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt; that they are smarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid those people. They are toxic and a total waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the rest, there is one simple question. One question to start the “conversion” process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find something that could be improved or that makes you unhappy with your current choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small crack of light will let you see their perspective and with &lt;strong&gt;empathy&lt;/strong&gt; you can understand why there is a push back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask a “flat-earther” what is &lt;strong&gt;one thing&lt;/strong&gt; that they disagree with the “flat earth theory”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask an investor if they could turn back time, what they would have made different. Any investments that might have be avoided? Any lost opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use empathy to relate and approach their point of view and I GUARANTEE you that even the most difficult and rigid people will crack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they are idiots, doesn’t mean that you should be too.&lt;/p&gt;

If not, let me introduce you to &lt;strong&gt;surfing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is everyone surfing right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blame it to the lockdown or to a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3SMg088j8"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt;, surfing seems to have attracted a lot of people the last 6 months.

If not, let me introduce you to &lt;strong&gt;surfing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is everyone surfing right now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blame it to the lockdown or to a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_K3SMg088j8"&gt;YouTubers&lt;/a&gt;, surfing seems to have attracted a lot of people the last 6 months. Or maybe because &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; started surfing like a maniac. This is called by the way the &lt;strong&gt;Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt; or frequency bias. It is the same as buying a car and then you keep noticing that there are so many people driving the same car are you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried surfing as soon as I moved to Los Angeles from San Francisco. And I sucked. I mean, I enjoyed it and was spending more than two hours fighting with the waves and making little progress but swimming + exercising + friends is a pretty sweet deal. Then, I stopped. Until 6 months ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hooked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unlocked the next stage of surfing randomly, when I went to a beginners surfing point just to get some exercise, having &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; expectations about riding a wave. Oh, little did I know. All of a sudden I could ride waves. &lt;strong&gt;I COULD SURF&lt;/strong&gt;. It seems that trying to start surfing in a 3-4 feet waves which trust me &lt;em&gt;are huge&lt;/em&gt; when you are confronted by them, isn't the best intro for surfing. It builds your skills though: balance, explosiveness, paddling in the water and knowing how to dodge waves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was it. I was hooked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The sport of the Gods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winds are traveling the universe and end up on Earth caressing the ocean to create waves, harnessing the gravity of the moon and the sun and then this powerful and majestic mass of awesomeness is calling you to try and ride it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is nothing similar to this feeling in the whole universe. You cannot be more connected with everything. You cannot feel smaller yet bigger than this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not why surfing is so addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dogs, cats and rats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pavlof find out that &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any behavior that is rewarded, is likely to be repeated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He figured out that when a bell rings and you immediately reward a dog with treats, the dog will be condition to expect a treat (and salivate) whenever a bell is rung. We all know how this works and applied to products but Skinner took it waaaaay further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. F. Skinner was the father of behavior analysis. If you don't know about Skinner, please read this excellent book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skinner figure out that he can boost the "salivating" (even though he was using mostly rats) by randomizing the reward. 
The rats were hitting a lever and they were getting a reward but not everytime. Sometimes the reward was small. Sometimes huge. Sometimes there was no rewards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rats were going crazy waiting for their random dopamine hit. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Schedules_of_reinforcement"&gt;This variable schedule of rewards&lt;/a&gt; is more effective that what Pavlof found out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the reason why surfing is so addictive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are sitting on your board, waiting for the next "perfect" wave. Tons of waves come but none is perfect. Sometimes you spend 30 minutes just waiting. And then the universe sends you a wave. Randomly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see it and immediately you have an adrenaline rush. Dopanine is already hitting you, even before catching the wave. &lt;strong&gt;This is it&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start paddling, you feel the gentle push that is becoming violent and as you are connected with everything, time stops. Nothing else matters. &lt;strong&gt;This is it&lt;/strong&gt;. Your reward that you got sometimes was epic, medium or a face-plant to the water. Regardless of the reward though, you are hooked. You want to do it again. You crave for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unpredictable rewards in products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating this to a product is not as tricky as you think and it is used in almost everything already (gaming, social networks, casinos).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea is making any reward that you have for the user &lt;strong&gt;variable&lt;/strong&gt;. Not in terms of time but in terms of benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For gaming, any rewards should be randomized. You completed you quest? Fantastic! Here is your random &lt;strong&gt;loot box&lt;/strong&gt;.
For a platform that uses badges (which surprisingly are very effective), a &lt;strong&gt;random badge should be awarded&lt;/strong&gt; instead of a specific one. So many platforms are doing this wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anything that "unlocks" a next level - even buying a bigger plan, a random reward should be given. Users need to crave for the next cool thing that &lt;strong&gt;might get&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am experimenting with a Startup Course that I am building from scratch (everything, &lt;strong&gt;including the platform&lt;/strong&gt;) and I am seeing that random "powerups" have more than 60% engagement than predictable ones. Btw, if you want to participate in the beta of the Startup Course (The Donut Startup), &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;, send me an email and I'll send you an invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever experienced unpredictable rewards that worked on you? I'd love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had a personal website but I always had a blog. First on tumblr, then Jon.IO using Mailchimp, then on Medium and then on Substack. I loved them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that &lt;a href="https://substack.com/"&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; will be &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; blog/mailing list I will be using for a very long time (because substack is epic) but I wanted a little bit more control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control = Conversions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, everything has to be calculated. How many users came to the website, from where, which pages are performing, which articles are shared the most etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Having my own website got me more than 2000 subscribers in two weeks with 5 articles &lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was a fluke. But I've been doing this for some time now and I know how to talk with my audience and what my audience likes (hint: mostly Startups, trading and bad puns).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I am building a Startup Course on my own platform (because I want to include some features than are fun and aren't available anywhere else) and I want everything to be under the same theme and under my control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sure, sure. Why not NextJS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://substack.com/"&gt;NextJs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tailwindui.com/"&gt;Tailwind&lt;/a&gt; let's you build website super fast. Like, come on. It is ridiculous how epic this combination is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that I don't like is using bleeding edge software for "boring things" like the infrastructure of my blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is extremely easy to hack around, it will be working as it is for the next decade and if not, I can rebuild it. You can see that
it &lt;a href="https://jon.io"&gt;Jon.IO&lt;/a&gt; doesn't look like the standard Pelican installation but it uses most of the nifty plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tailwind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea why but my (first) new version was not using tailwind and that was stupid. What you see here was built in less than a day and it is exactly how I want it to be - web and mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Continuous deployment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously. Commiting to the master branch on Github, triggers a Github hook and the new article (which is written in Markdown) is posted.
The RSS feed is updated and SendFox sends automatically an email to the mailing list (depending on the category).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough with the stupid flexing. Is it opensource?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously. Go and fork here,  &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;sign up to the mailing list&lt;/a&gt; and ping me if you have any questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Based on Space (&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mrigapps.andriod.breakfree.deux&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-break-phone-addiction/id916126783?mt=8"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes &lt;strong&gt;I spend more than 7 hours per day&lt;/strong&gt; just on my phone. Yes, sounds a lot and you will be surprised how much time you actually spend without even realizing. Google Maps, Spotify, Gmail, Phone calls, calendar, 
etc etc really adds up. See, I didn’t even add Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram or Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, as an Entrepreneur I don’t need an office but that means that I work a lot on the go (thus the glued phone on my hand). Nah, this is just an excuse! STOP FOOLING YOURSELF!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for a change&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday morning I decided to try a Digital Sabbath. What is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Sabbath is a hipster way to stop using digital devices for a whole day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rules were simple: No phones, no tablets, no laptops and gaming devices. And definitely no Internet. Sounds easy right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My morning started having breakfast in the backyard without having Netflix or YouTube in the background. And of course no music (no Spotify). Damn, I should have gotten an old fashion radio. Maybe order it from Amazon? Damn, no Amazon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I finished building a gym in my house that I’ve been postponing for some time but hey, Instagram stories during the weekends are so juicy (update: no, they are not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could hear my phone ringing (I should have turned it off but now I am not allowed to touch it) and probably it’s my friends trying to coordinate for coffee, drinks, activities. I hope someone drops by so I can tell them about my sabbath. And I really want to be blasting Black Sabbath when they arrive but I don’t know any Sabbath songs on the guitar except Paranoid and I cannot go online to find tablatures. Yes, this is &lt;a href="https://people.com/politics/trump-boasted-of-avoiding-stds-while-dating-vaginas-are-landmines-it-was-my-personal-vietnam/"&gt;my personal Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward, one of my friends dropped by for coffee and propagates the news to our network. I could hear the laughs behind every blink-blink of the Facebook Messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now it is time for coffee! And has to be somewhere near by as we have a No Google Maps policy. Or at least I cannot use Google Maps. As I wonder if we should go outdoors or indoors I almost caught myself asking “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”. Not today Google. Not today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrive at the coffee place while chatting in the car without anyone checking Twitter, Facebook or Instagram as I have this profound energy consuming the social space around me and I say “coffee is on me”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Digital Sabbath made me realize how awesome technology is and how ingrained is in our everyday lives. And &lt;strong&gt;apparently you cannot even buy coffee at coffee shops without using a tablet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day turns into night and we go out for drinks and then food and I end the day reading a &lt;strong&gt;physical book&lt;/strong&gt; which I had mostly as decoration as I do all my reading on Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved every single bit (ha! puns!) of the experience. I really enjoyed waiting in line and not checking my phone and just watching people (checking their phones). It was a strange meditative exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually seemed that people became more talkative and open. Who knew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Am I doing it again next Saturday?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OF COURSE! But I will optimize it a little bit. This impromptu digital seclusion made communicating with friends &lt;em&gt;adventurous&lt;/em&gt; (at least in the beginning) as no-one knew about my experiment. Now they will know that we just have to stick to plans we made from Friday and they have to help me get coffee. Oh and I will definitely buy a small radio (in your face Spotify).&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The #RoamCult: Why creating a cult for your Startups is what you should be doing right now</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-roamcult-why-creating-a-cult-for-your-startups-is-what-you-should-be-doing-right-now" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-07-11T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;Or why you should have a "Believer" plan&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recurring revenue. Two words synonym to predictable revenue and known for bringing smiles and high-fives to VCs and founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every single tech company I know has a recurring revenue business model. Even the big ones are trying moving to a SaaS model by becoming Cloud-first/ready or whatever bullshit (come on it is 2020 already).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe there is a new business model. The Believer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Roam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out about &lt;a href="https://roamresearch.com/"&gt;Roam&lt;/a&gt; a couple weeks ago - a company that created a ton of buzz with their #roamcult and having a “Believers” plan. This is not an advertisement of the product and I am not an investor at Roam. But I am a believer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premise is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of paying $15 per month or $165 per year, how about you pay $500 for &lt;strong&gt;five years&lt;/strong&gt;? One of the pros is of course the 40% discount but what about the cons?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Will the company still existing in five years? This is a brand new startup after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ Having access to brand new features before anyone else is cool but is it that cool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting business model and definitely could spark a new trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Believers: Building your “cult”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some products that are epic. People love them. They just love them. They are irrationally obsessed with them. These are the believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers are the people that if you had a heavy metal band, they &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/metallica-drive-in-shows-1041638/"&gt;will travel 5 hours to see you performing a pre-recorded show in a drive-in&lt;/a&gt;. These people have a deep connection with your product and they get the maximum value out of it. It might even be part of their identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can you identify your believers and how to give them incentives them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding your Believers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I built a Startup, there were some users that were a pain in the ass. Non-stop questions and criticism on a daily basis. My team has asked me giving them a refund and be done with it. But&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never let your believers get away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People that engage like crazy with your product/brand and are vocal, are your believers. Or your haters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believers and haters are separated by a thin line called &lt;strong&gt;constructive feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn how to recognize the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to find your believers is by talking non-stop to your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending an email every month doesn’t cut it. Keep them in the loop with webinars, twitch broadcasts, previews of new features, asking for feedback etc. The believers are the people that log in the most and engage the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rewarding believers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An epic idea is something that Roam did with their “cult”. They gave the opportunity to their believers participate in the financial round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/roam.PNG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of your struggling to raise money, consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Startup is giving the opportunity to its users to participate in the round. Not only the product is awesome, not only there are customers using it, there are users that love it so much that want to be with you for the long run. People knock on your door to give you money.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty good scenario for fund raising in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn’t this like a one-time-fee thingy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. It is more about the money. It’s always been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product is the sum of the value it provides and the emotional connection that has with its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking that you can just add one plan in your pricing page and people will flock and turn into believers is naive. Oh sorry, it is not naive. It is actually stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a fan base/cult/believer requires that the company is transparent and let’s everyone (that wants to) participate in the decision making. In my opinion there hasn’t been enough innovation in pricing models and more experiments should be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows. Maybe you can try creating your own cult and find new ways to make people connect with your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all find reasons not to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find reasons not to exercise (I don’t have time - I feel tired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find reasons not to eat healthy, find time for ourselves or maybe read that book that I bought from Amazon about bird watching and I am waiting for the weather to be perfect so I can sit in my backyard to identify the birds but it is a bit cold and I don’t know whether birds fly that much when it is cold, maybe next weekend or…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough with the chit-chat. Let’s do some smashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 3 tricks to smash your goals RIGHT NOW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your calendar. Else time will control you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your energy levels. Else you are fighting yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control who surrounds you. To flourish you need nutrients and not &lt;a href="it-is-bullshit-that-you-are-the-average-of-the-5-people-you-spend-most-time-with.html"&gt;toxicity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 (bonus)/ Relinquish control. Practice no attachment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1/ Controlling your calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to have tons of meetings back to back. I implemented &lt;a href="scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger.html"&gt;this trick from Arnold&lt;/a&gt; and it worked but I found a state of mind that was more efficient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever someone asks for a meeting, I treat it as if they are stealing from my personal time. They are stealing from the time I have to help people, be with the ones I love or work on my company and my goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me very conscious about random meetings and I dedicate more energy for the meetings that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a non-essential meetings is scheduled right now or after 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2/ Control your energy levels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is literally a game changer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love answering emails and writing articles in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like reading at 11am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be done with exercising before 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like having calls after 2pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to fit everything based “on time of the day” instead of your personal energy levels is 100% wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to listen to yourself and figure out the times you are more creative, have more energy or you need downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to do it is track when you kick ass in your &lt;a href="/the-joy-journal.html"&gt;Joy Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3/ Control who surrounds you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard that “you are the average Of The Five People You Spend The Most Time With”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are toxic and bad-mouthing others behind their back, that negativity will cloud your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are bitching all day long about how others are responsible for everything, you will never get charge of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="it-is-bullshit-that-you-are-the-average-of-the-5-people-you-spend-most-time-with.html"&gt;You will become the people that surround you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4 (bonus)/ Relinquish control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Japan, I attended a seminar about Mandala. The idea behind it is that you spent A LOT OF TIME to create something beautiful and then you have to destroy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, it seems like the definition of wasting time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this exercise taught me that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is forever&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letting go is part of evolving&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denounce control to regain control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I leave you today with a video I got when I was riding the Bullet Train in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I am going to show you &lt;strong&gt;how to love it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiating is the most important skill that any Entrepreneur should have. And it is the only skill that helped me save my company a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked before about &lt;a href="win-in-every-negotiation.html"&gt;information asymmetry&lt;/a&gt; which is a fancy word for knowing something that the other person doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two times I raised money for my Startup, I did it through &lt;a href="https://fundersclub.com/learn/safe-primer/safe-primer/safe/"&gt;SAFE&lt;/a&gt;. It also took me just a week to close the round but that is another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAFE has many advantages (and disadvantages of course) but the most important advantage is that it gives you &lt;strong&gt;an informational edge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NUMBER ONE issue that I face whenever I am fund raising is having the first couple of investors &lt;strong&gt;commit&lt;/strong&gt;. After that it is much easier. So much easier. But what usually happens is that everyone waits for the other person to make the first move and then &lt;strong&gt;ALL of them have to go together at the same time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/bulls.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or even worse, you round has to close at a specific date and if you don't have all your investors lined up - poof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You.should.never.do.this&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAFE gives you the informational edge as your investors can come in random order. You can even have your round open all year long if you want. There is no start and end date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your fund raising conversation should be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey we have a round open, with minimum $25k to fund our sales. The cap is $10M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it more interesting is that you can give different terms to different investors (we call this &lt;strong&gt;high resolution investing&lt;/strong&gt;) based on how early they join the round, their importance or the amount money the put in your company. All with the same, super simple document. Pure epicness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take this example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For early investors, I am willing to give a cap of $3M and 10% discount. After I reach $500k, I won’t give any discount but one investor that I consider strategic I want her to join so I give her a cap of $2.5M and 10% discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 6 months, I am killing it but I have a couple of people that are still interested so then can join with a $5M cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same document. No legal fees. Plus, you don’t corner yourself by having to coordinate with all the investor and push them to commit before an end date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever tried doing fund raising using Converting Debt or equity, first of all you are an idiot and second of all open your eyes and see how it is done with SAFE. Unless you are a masochist. Or an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category><category term="popular"></category></entry><entry><title>It is bullshit that you are the average of the 5 people you spend most time with</title><link href="http://jon.io/it-is-bullshit-that-you-are-the-average-of-the-5-people-you-spend-most-time-with" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-06-06T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;h2&gt;You will become the people that surround you.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your group is toxic and bad-mouthing others behind their back, you will start too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are bitching all day long about how others are responsible for everything, you will start too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they love their 9-5 job and you want to be an Entrepreneur, I have some bad news for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Action plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drop anyone that is bad mouthing others&lt;/strong&gt;. And I am not talking about teasing. You need to focus your time and energy on building cool stuff and not talking about other people’s lives. Everyone has their own issues and problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop bitching (unless it’s for releasing stress)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add diversity&lt;/strong&gt;. For me that was a huge pivotal point in my life. I am blessed that I have friends with different backgrounds, different opinions and different goals in life. Thank you :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put something recurring on the calendar&lt;/strong&gt;. I love having our Thursday basketball or our “guys night out” (where we don’t go out but we have barbecue). Creating traditions with friends is what creates stronger connections. Plus, if you cannot stand a person over a barbecue, well… you know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But sadly because I had a Startup, I had to go to Palo Alto, Mountain View, Oakland for meetings and events. That meant that I had to rent a car or waste hours on public transportation and Uber/Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Startup that never raised money from a VC, I knew we had to rent a car but our budget was best case $1200 per month. That’s $66 per day, including insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Information Asymmetry.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information asymmetry is a fancy word of saying “I know something that you don’t”. You can use that when you negotiate for a job, with customers, with sales people and you girlfriend/wife when it is time to do the dishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the first step, we need to identify our &lt;strong&gt;informational advantage&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The informational advantage I had was the length of the rent. 30 days is not usual. I decided to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you want to rent a car, the typical conversation goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I would like a car from that date to that date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I see, we have this model and that model for $12 more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking for the cheaper option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got it, that is $100 per day plus insurance, plus taxes for 3 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using information asymmetry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, I would like a car for three days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I see, we have this model and that model for $4 more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, what is the price for the cheaper model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will be $100 per day plus insurance, plus taxes for three days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is roughly $100 per day, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is correct&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we do something better if I wanted the car for a week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could do $95 if it is for week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing! Thank you a lot. You know what, if we can do something better in terms of pricing, I could go for three weeks as I don’t want to bring the car back again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see. The best I can do if you go for a whole month is $90&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you! That is perfect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way we used information asymmetry was by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; revealing all the information we had in one go but in a &lt;strong&gt;dripping style&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can it work when you negotiate your salary? Of course it can!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to gather as much information as you can before going for an interview. That means knowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average salary for that position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average salary for that position in &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other possible perks (extra stocks, more vacation days)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this information, we are in an informational disadvantage as we have no idea whether the salary that we want is &lt;strong&gt;even feasible&lt;/strong&gt; for that company. Yes, an engineer can make $350k in a public tech company but in a small Startup that is doubtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my whole professional career, I managed to get &lt;strong&gt;way more&lt;/strong&gt; than any other of my peers in terms of salary, bonuses, stocks and vacation days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if it sparks revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I am the person that has 53 different hobbies and is good at three of them. And I don’t plan changing any time soon as I subscribe to the &lt;a href="jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything.html"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself if it sparks revenue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I am the person that has 53 different hobbies and is good at three of them. And I don’t plan changing any time soon as I subscribe to the &lt;a href="jack-of-many-trades-master-of-anything.html"&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything&lt;/a&gt; theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I am like a hoarder that finds “joy” in everything. Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Startups, I have to be more intentional. I don’t use the word “focused” because this term is used by people that have one brain cell and cannot do more than two things at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliminating the unnecessary&lt;/strong&gt; is the most critical skill in a Startup and companies folded in just two weeks after Corona Virus started because they were on a “hiring spree, renting bigger offices” instead of “focusing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can Marie Kondo give us some tips?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The KonMari rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KonMari method has six rules:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commit yourself to tidying up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine your ideal lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish discarding first. Before getting rid of items, sincerely thank each item for serving its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidy by category, not location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the right order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself it it sparks joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s “Silicon Valey” these rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1/ Clean up your business data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Commit yourself to tidying up” is the best advice for getting all your data in one place. If you don’t know how things are, how do you know what to improve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goals in Google Analytics that no-one is checking out? Clean them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Instagram account that you keep posting but you don’t track any conversions? Goodbye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2/ Imaging your ideal “exit”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to build a business that makes tons of revenue? Is this an acquihire game so you don’t really need a lot of customers? Do you want to raise money and work hard to keep VCs happy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about your future. “Imagine your ideal lifestyle”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3/ Firing before hiring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be pretty obvious but 99% of VC-funded companies seem to have no idea how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before randomly hiring people and celebrating your “headcount”, ask if every single employee provides value to your mission. More employees that you just hired to satisfy your investors means more stress on your financials, slower product development, more red tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t hire 100 engineers. Hire ten 10x engineers (yes, I hate that term too, just play along).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie said it loud and clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish discarding first. Before getting rid of items, sincerely thank each item for serving its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would add that you might want to give something more than just a thank you for your service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4/ Hire the best: Location is irrelevant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I got the “Tidy by category, not location” and I opened it up a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in the past about &lt;a href="why-i-love-working-remotely-and-why-your-company-cannot-and-never-will.html"&gt;working remotely&lt;/a&gt; and if you company STILL doesn’t allow remote working I can assume that you are running a coffee place or a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5/ Follow the right order&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are “cleaning up” your company, you should prioritize customers/sales, support, product development and then anything else. Nothing else should matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you taking the whole company to Tahoe this winter? Awesome. Make sure that everything else is in place first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6/ Ask yourself if it sparks revenue/value&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever you are doing needs to have only one goal: revenue (or adding value to customers). No-one cares about a better looking website. Or about using the latest in backend technology. Or that you have 34303403011 employees in 232 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOES IT MAKE MONEY?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, I was surprised because the most important question someone that wants to start a business should ask is how to make a product that people want. Anything else is details. Short of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the exercises we had, was to think of a product that could generate $1 per month. If you think that is easy, I challenge you to try it out. It requires a pretty good amount of thinking and planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limitations we had were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have one day to prepare&lt;/strong&gt;. That means no overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot spend any money (no ads)&lt;/strong&gt;. You have to use your existing network (friend, family, social networks)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You cannot use any external resources&lt;/strong&gt;. Getting creative or learning some basic building (and selling) skills is something you need to do if you want to run a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you had all this in place, you had to pitch your idea to the whole class. Who knows, you might get some subscribers for your idea on the spot (hint: no one did but it is a good exercise treating everyone as a potential customer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw at least 30 different ideas that managed to make $1 to $250 recurring monthly revenue and to tell you the truth, it blew my mind. But more importantly it blew &lt;strong&gt;THEIR&lt;/strong&gt; mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We proved that you don’t need a lot of money, huge infrastructure and 10 people to try out an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who are wondering, the next step was to “build a company” that makes $1,000 per month then $10,000 and finally $1,000,000 per month. That way we could talk about &lt;strong&gt;finding a co-founder&lt;/strong&gt;, talk about &lt;strong&gt;funding&lt;/strong&gt; and how and when &lt;strong&gt;to scale&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning more, I plan to post on a weekly basis my “how to Startup” so just &lt;a href="pages/weekly-tips"&gt;follow along&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now back to making money from zero money. My favorite subject. 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by picking up an idea. We want something that might generate at least $1 per month. Write that idea down and place it as background in your phone. Like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by picking up an idea. We want something that might generate at least $1 per month. Write that idea down and place it as background in your phone. Like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="mario" src="/images/mario.png"&gt;
I used Instagram to make this, so don't judge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ideas to get your creative juices flowing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram retouch service&lt;/strong&gt;. Retouch all photos that someone posts on social media. I know a friend that makes $1500 per month just for light retouching. I even paid $10 on reddit to have this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="jonking" src="/images/jonking.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Websites&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you know how to setup Squarespace? Or Wix? Or Wordpress? If not, you should. It is very easy. Charge for management fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online talent company&lt;/strong&gt;. It will sound silly but there many influencers on YouTube/Instagram/TikTok that have decent traffic and no idea how to monetize it. They will LOVE a manager to handle this. Leave a comment below if you want to learn more about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this exercise is not to make money and retire in a Greek Island. It is to understand how sales and marketing works and making something that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you found your idea, time to get some customers and validate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You start with your friends, family and expand to your social media. After that you go on Reddit, Craigslist, your local newspaper and Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fantasize that you could do it, &lt;strong&gt;stop right now&lt;/strong&gt; and actually do it. And then send me your a screenshot of your hustle and &lt;strong&gt;I’ll be the first person to send you $1 via Venmo&lt;/strong&gt;. No bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>The beauty in being the underdog</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-beauty-in-being-the-underdog" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-03-29T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of podcasts …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last three months, I am (kind of) doing a show by Entrepreneurs for Entrepreneurs. I know, I know you are going to tell me that “everyone is doing a podcast or has a YouTube channel nowadays”. And I agree. But hear me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are tons of podcasts out there and more YouTube channels about Startups and hustling that I won’t even bother looking for a link to back this up with some data. Trust me on this one. But 99% of those, talk to the same people about the same freaking thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you graduated from Stanford, had an idea, raised money and then the company got acquired? How awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about the underdogs? The people that for one reason or another cannot go through that path?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long live the underdogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love being the underdog, the outsider. The person that has the least chances of succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friends told me that I thrive in that state because it removes the anxiety of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you fail, it is expected. And if you succeed, you are 🚀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that being the underdog forces you in a continuous state of competition. You take nothing for granted and you need to keep fighting. Hustling. You have to keep finding ways to come on top so you innovate. You pivot. You take more chances and you cannot stop because you are not Number 1. Hell, you are not even in the first ten places!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what, sometimes everything just works. You get in that flow and things are starting to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The underdog mentality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, getting to that state is pretty easy. I just start something new that probably will fail majestically (like a book, a podcast or planning to become the Major of Los Angeles) that I have no idea how to do and I try to do it. Succeeding doesn’t matter (in the beginning) because I get to learn SO many cool skills and I get to get over my “everything has to be perfect” plague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people love to watch Netflix or read a book. I just like to fail :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as Ice-T said in one of my episodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are good at something, you learn how to get good at something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being focused is awesome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest resolutions for 2020 was to guard my time and energy like Cerberus - the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being focused is awesome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest resolutions for 2020 was to guard my time and energy like Cerberus - the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason is that I need more time for my projects. Besides &lt;a href="https://agentrisk.com"&gt;AgentRisk&lt;/a&gt; that takes most of my time, I have tons of other projects that compete for my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are small - like releasing &lt;a href="why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands.html"&gt;my book&lt;/a&gt; in a printed version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other projects are on-going - like using &lt;strong&gt;petri dish for my biohacking experiments&lt;/strong&gt; or learning Russian. And others are much bigger - like the soon-to-be-released TV Show or improving my drawing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I could do 16 hours non-stop every day for 6 months and I wouldn’t be done with half of my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the goal is not to be done. I enjoy the process. I literally enjoy having many hobbies and learning new stuff. &lt;strong&gt;And it only makes me better at everything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jack of all trades, master of none&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” is criminally stupid. It wasn’t even applicable when the whole of humanity was working on the fields and we had to specialize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know how to seed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to learn about business. I don’t need to learn about the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to know about trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t need to know about economics. No need to know about computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticket straight to unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reroute to remain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your “idol” and see how he/she knows more than their craft. &lt;strong&gt;Way&lt;/strong&gt; more. Usually, they merge ideas from different fields and create something new. &lt;strong&gt;Jack of many trades, Master of Anything&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any intelligent creator understands that you need to control the whole creative process and that means that you have to know way more than your main craft. The most successful musicians not only have their own record company but they have expanded to other fields totally unrelated to their profession. And they kick ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my friend Ice-T said in one of my episodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are good at something, you learn how to get good at something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you acquire a new skill &lt;strong&gt;at any level&lt;/strong&gt;, your chances of success are multiplying x2. Or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why people get intimidated when they hear about new projects. Usually, they struggle with just their everyday job and they cannot understand that to grow they need to be cross-pollinated by different skills in different fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, being focused is &lt;strong&gt;an amazing thing&lt;/strong&gt; if you are a drone, want a 9-to-5 job and have zero creativity. But we are already suppressed enough in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let your inner creator make a mess. That’s the only way we grow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>The Joy Journal</title><link href="http://jon.io/the-joy-journal" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-02-08T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;li&gt;70% was pretty good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;7% was ok&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0.8% was bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;0% was terrible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it was a pretty good year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is kind of difficult to explain and quantify “happy” as my definition of happiness is something between building stuff, lifting heavy weights (and getting physically injured), Startups (getting emotionally injured) and doing stuff with people I love. No pain, no gain, no happiness, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me on LinkedIn why my 2019 was (in general) a pretty happy year. Was it gratitude? Friends? Drugs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have no idea. I remember being super happy with Katya and friends, laughing, going on the beach and chilling in the sun. I remember being happy when we did a kick-ass release at AgentRisk and I was dropping off Alex 11pm at his home — knowing that the whole team gave their 110%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don’t remember the exact moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;📖Enter Joy Journal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this year I am trying a Joy Journal — with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joy journal is a physical book where you right things that make you happy. Then, you keep doing these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, data geeks love actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My JJ (that’s how cool kids call Joy Journal — and by “cool kids” I mean only me at this moment) is like a normal journal but with more data. Whatever you have in your mind. Double it. And then double it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="data" src="/images/dataguy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use my phone instead of a physical book and I write down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time &amp;amp; date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who else is with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The environment (context)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why I feel happy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also snap a picture and put everything in my Evernote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to find the things (and the environment) that make me consistently happy and keep having more of it. No idea if that simple method will work out but it worths the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you tried a Joy Journal? Do you have any cool ideas? I would love to hear them!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I wrote a book about my hands</title><link href="http://jon.io/why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-30T10:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

That was …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was 2015 and my Startup had just &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAJJC"&gt;got acquired&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://splunk.com"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, a multi-billion dollar Company in the Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Athens/Greece at that point and for the first time, I didn’t have to think 24/7 about customers, bugs and scaling the company. That was someone’s else problem now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that free mental cycles, I decided to focus my energy to something new (at least for me): a book. Or as I’ve been saying since then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE BOOK&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pitched &lt;a href="https://whatidowithmyhands.com/"&gt;What I do With My Hands&lt;/a&gt; to my friend, &lt;a href="http://www.asiomou.com/"&gt;Anastasia&lt;/a&gt; and she loved the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I &lt;strong&gt;loved&lt;/strong&gt; the idea - she just played along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;These 10 little Celebrities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We met at my Airbnb in Athens (oh yes, I was staying in Airbnb all over the world for the last three years - hashtag StartupLife) and we came up with these cool(?) things that you can do with your hands. Why? Seriously, I don’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="It was on my todo list for a long time" src="/images/handtrello.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the book spent &lt;strong&gt;five years&lt;/strong&gt; in my Trello todo list, taunting at me, laughing at me and promising eternal glory and recognition. The main reason was me, over-engineering the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to find the perfect layout, website, page, intro everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we all know, being a perfectionist is how you get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ship the fricking book!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2019 has been a shifting year for me. I reevaluated so many things in my life but more importantly I decided that taking yourself seriously is the worst thing it can happen to your personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go back to basics and start creating more. And then some more. And then add on that. And the first step was releasing that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikve"&gt;Vivi&lt;/a&gt;, made sure that it renders correctly on even the oldest of Amazon Kindle and then fought with the Amazon’s layout creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a free template for the website, got the domain, hosted the website on Github Pages and here you go. Available on Amazon and (in the next couple of weeks) available as a coffee table book. You’ll be able to read it soon in all the hipster coffee places in San Francisco and Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t intend to make money from the book - I keep running “free book” promotions on Amazon but I can do only five days every 90 days. If you want to read it and don’t want to spend $2 on Amazon, send me an email and I’ll send you a PDF version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out that whenever I do “soul projects” expecting returns or outside validation I hate the process and I end up getting bored. I know, it is kind of obvious but I keep forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Projects"></category></entry><entry><title>Why I love working remotely (and why your company cannot and never will)</title><link href="http://jon.io/why-i-love-working-remotely-and-why-your-company-cannot-and-never-will" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-10-18T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

Yes, not a slice but a whole pizza. Don’t judge, this is my lunch and I have a long day/night ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 9am in California and usually around that time, companies are ready to have their Standup where everyone talks for less than 10 seconds and says what was done yesterday, what needs to be done today and if there are any show-stoppers. In our case, everyone is working from another state (or country) and I can assure you it takes us waaay longer than 10 seconds. Waaaaaay longer. Not because we are apart but because we like to talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am logging in today from Italy and the internet in this Airbnb keeps dropping all the time. And I feel a bit sleepy which is definitely the jet-lag and not the pizza. Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being on my fourth Startup, I kinda know how not to annoy everybody with my stuttering voice so I have Google Fi and it works pretty good. Most of the times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Google Fi for the rescue" src="/images/googlefi.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same goes for my co-founder Niko that has strategically selected the best noise-to-work-to-view place at a coffee place in New York (it is lunch time for him), Maria in Salt Lake City that is doing some upgrades in her house while showing us our new epic homepage (and her new patio), Rania grilling us (mostly me) for not having compliance approved any blog posts (ha, add this to the list!) while she is about to put the kids to sleep (is it 7pm in Athens/ Greece), Alex trying to fight off his food cravings by entering a meditative state through product development (three more hours to breaks his intermitting fasting in Los Angeles) and more people jumping on and off or reporting on Slack. Good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some of us it is the beginning of the working day, for others the middle or the end which makes things tricky to plan. Oh and some people are on vacations (we have an unlimited vacations policy). Did I say good times? Good times again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having lived in this environment for almost ten years and a half version of it at Splunk which acquired my last company, I can tell you why this is the best way to work. The healthiest and the happiest. And then I can tell you why your company cannot do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why we can do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to work, the whole team needs to be aligned. Needs to be aware that “working from everywhere” means that you need to make sure you have stable internet connection, no noise and that you can work concentrated. We cannot have someone that needs to be (micro)managed. You need to be self-motivated. And you need to be really good at what you are doing. Reeeeaally good. You need to be an one-army man/woman. But the reward is that you get to have pizza while building products and having fun with a view like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why your company sucks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups used to be about working from a garage with a team of super dedicated and smart engineers. They were makers. Creators. They could work all day/night and they would radiate passion and will inspire people to join them. Not only for the perks. Not only or the salary. But mostly for the vision.
I know that you are thinking “hey man, we need to pay bills and you cannot buy medical insurance with passion”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correct. But if you want to evolve as an employee (and as a person?), you need to demand more than just a simple transaction of “money &amp;lt;&amp;gt; time”: Someone gives you money, you give back your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let me give you an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We built AgentRisk to help Entrepreneurs manage their money better. More transparently. We even provide free education for cryptocurrencies. &lt;strong&gt;No this is not a product pitch&lt;/strong&gt;. What I am trying to say is that every single customer we have, was an employee at some point and then became &lt;strong&gt;obsessed with a problem&lt;/strong&gt;. They worked like there is no tomorrow, failed, tried again, failed, tried again and then made it. They freaking made it. And I am not saying that they just made money. They are better, more rounded as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is the reason why your company cannot let you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies hire people that don’t have passion. That don’t have vision. They need you to work 9–5 at an office so that a manager can nano-manage you. Vacations are not unlimited because they think you will be on vacations all the time. And of course you end up wasting time and time and time again in meetings (ok some companies are not like that but you get my point).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But at least you get to pay the bills, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you can do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working remotely is not for everyone obviously and not everyone is a super engineer. The truth is in the middle and companies just don’t know how to run remote teams. It takes time and dedication and many times I prefer being with the whole team at an office (we fly all together in one place) than on Google Hangouts. But working from wherever you want, is liberating. And the pizza is not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Startups"></category></entry><entry><title>Scheduling meetings like Arnold Schwarzenegger</title><link href="http://jon.io/scheduling-meetings-like-arnold-schwarzenegger" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-06-12T10:48:00-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

I have to stop you right there and tell you that you are wrong and I am right and I am awesome and you should shut up and read this epic post that will change your life. Ready? Let’s do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Total Recall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was reading a new book that talks about Arnold’s life, called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Total-Recall-Unbelievably-True-Story/dp/1451662440"&gt;Total Recall&lt;/a&gt; and he mentioned how he books appointments and generally manages his day and time. And when I say Arnold, I mean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_career_of_Arnold_Schwarzenegger"&gt;Arnold&lt;/a&gt; in case you &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Mr._Olympia"&gt;didn’t understand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His trick is pretty simple and he’s been doing it for more than 20 years. Here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn’t have a weekly or monthly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that Arnold doesn’t schedule ANY &lt;strong&gt;appointments&lt;/strong&gt; in the future. Do you want to talk to him? You can do it later today and that’s it. Or if it is super important, you can talk to him &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way Arnold can focus on what is &lt;strong&gt;important to him&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;focus&lt;/strong&gt;, instead of having his whole life dictated by Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="What? It is an image of Arnold and a Calendar. Point made." src="/images/fat.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now we are getting to the part where you say to yourself: I cannot do that! I have people to meet, business meetings, skype calls etc etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The part where you say bullshit to yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a Founder (currently on my fourth Startup) and an Angel Investor and my schedule for at least three weeks in advance is sold out. And I am not bragging because &lt;strong&gt;this sucked&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means that if I (and the Governor of California) can do this, you can do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, I decided to give it a try and not schedule meetings for more than 3 days in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some interactions, it was flawless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I want to ask you for a new crypto strategy, how is your schedule next week?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello there! I try not to schedule any meetings that far into the future in order to focus on what’s important right now. Do you have time to meet tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure! Let’s do it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Jon, we are still trying to figure out how this integration will work. Maybe setup a meeting at the end of the month?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello Andy, I try not to schedule meetings that far into the future so let’s talk tomorrow or around the end of the month to set something up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, ok. Let me see if we can do something this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it didn’t work AT ALL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey man, we plan to have a Founder’s meeting in a couple of weeks from now. Are you coming (I need to confirm seating).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yo, I suppose but can we please talk next week again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s this bullshit TimFerris-y thing that you are doing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferris is a fake Entrepreneur, I am doing the Schwarzenegger thing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will I keep doing it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 3 is almost over and again my life is dictated by Google Calendar but only 3 days in the future (faint hoooraaaay).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The huge difference is managing my energy levels&lt;/strong&gt; (which maybe is more important than managing time) because I can arrange meetings based on what I feel working on right now and focus on what is important for me and the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back with me in a couple of weeks ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Placing your first Forex trade with Python</title><link href="http://jon.io/placing-your-first-forex-trade-with-python" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-06T22:48:00-08:00</published><updated>2021-06-05T06:51:30-07:00</updated><author><name>Jon V &lt;h2&gt;BigData.

&lt;p&gt;Time to talk about brokers, how to place a trade programmatically and most importantly how not to get scammed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the third part of the series: &lt;a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html"&gt;How to build your own algotrading platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broker is nothing more than a company that lets you trade (buy or sell) assets on a market through their platform. What is very important for algotrading is: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The broker offers an API in order for us to place orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have a demo account to run your staging environment and experiment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The spread is as small as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our case, we don't really care about spread as we won't be doing High Frequency Trading any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though brokers are regulated, there have been incidents in the past couple of years, were brokers folded due to certain conditions. Be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; wary if &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no reviews of the broker on the internet (or most of them are bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the broker offers you some crazy leverage (like 1:200)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the broker seems to be in a very strange country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could happen is that you start making some money and you aren't be able to pull them out. Seriously. Super stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's switch to a happier note which is opening an account and placing our first programmatic trade. Whooha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am using &lt;a href="http://www.oanda.com/"&gt;Oanda&lt;/a&gt; as a broker (I am not affiliated with them) and they offer a pretty decent API, libraries on github and a free demo account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and open a free &lt;a href="https://www.oanda.com/register/#/sign-up/demo"&gt;fxTrade Practice account&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.oanda.com/demo-account/login"&gt;sign in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you sign in to your demo account, go to &lt;strong&gt;Manage API Access&lt;/strong&gt;. There you can find your API key which we are going to use in our system to place trades. &lt;strong&gt;MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHARE THIS KEY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for this is and all other posts is on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/Forex-algotrading"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and you can install it and run it pretty easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Oanda released a new (kickass) execution engine called &lt;strong&gt;v20&lt;/strong&gt; and they have released a new (improved) API. This post has been updated in order to use the new API but if (for any reason) you want to check the old code, it is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading/blob/86db3f7f567897ad74c1e611cf2d6f337f4a9c24/post3/runner.py"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;. You lucky you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecting to Oanda needs a conf file - which you can generate using a script that Oanda provides &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python-samples"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; you can just create it yourself. Why would you want that? First of all when it comes to credentials (and my money), I prefer to know everything that is going on. And I don't like having to install PyYAML just to read a conf file. Feel free to use either method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, prepare to be amazed. The code is straight-forward. We initialize the API:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;v20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;api-fxpractice.oanda.com&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;443&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;HERE GOES YOUR API KEY&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now let's place an order (buy 5000 units of EURUSD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;market&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ACCOUNT ID&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="n"&gt;instrument&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;EUR_USD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
             &lt;span class="n"&gt;units&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Response: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;)&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;reason&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;201&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Created&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check the current price is as easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utcnow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;isoformat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;T&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Z&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pricing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;account_id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;instruments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;EUR_USD&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;since&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;includeUnitsAvailable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;prices&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;latest_price_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="nb"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Buy at&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;price&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super easy. Don't worry about what EURUSD is or how many units we are buying or what a market order is. For now, we have placed our first trade from our laptop and we are going to build our own API to place trades. Exciting stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read Oanda's documentation &lt;a href="http://developer.oanda.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see what else you can do with their API and find the Python library &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.Tons of examples are available from Oanda's github page &lt;a href="https://github.com/oanda/v20-python-sample"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, connecting to a real &lt;strong&gt;LIVE&lt;/strong&gt; algotrading system, running from my RaspberryPI at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757245/jonio/trades-nov.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll be able to see the (almost) final program running and we'll talk more about Forex and strategies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also a real example with real returns (and real production errors that cost me money) where you can see how to identify opportunities, why algotrading is awesome and why risk management can save your ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the another post of the series: &lt;a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html"&gt;How to build your own algotrading platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get this question almost on a daily basis. How can I find a good strategy? How can I built my own? Do I need to have a PhD in mathematics? Statistics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsflash: If I can write a strategy, anyone can write a strategy. Trust me on that. The only trick is to &lt;strong&gt;look for a simple one&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: This post has been rewritten "at least" five times (as &lt;a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-s-dao-forking-crisis-the-bitcoin-perspective-1467404395"&gt;"The DAO drama"&lt;/a&gt; escalated) and it is the perfect example of a strategy doing a full circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started getting involved with &lt;a href="https://www.ethereum.org/"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; early on as I really liked the "run your algorithms on the blockchain" thing. When &lt;a href="https://daohub.org/"&gt;TheDAO&lt;/a&gt; came out, I read everything about it and loved the idea.
You don't need to understand what Ethereum, theDAO, blockchain is at this point (I promise I will ramble on a another post). The same ideas apply to Forex, Stocks even Pokemon balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;     As I said before, simple ideas turn into (simple?) strategies.
     Complex strategies turn into mayhem that is impossible to backtest
     and deploy without errors.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; My four step - captain obvious - system &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally, have a specific way that I work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step one&lt;/em&gt; : Identify an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea in this case is that there are a couple of exchanges offering Ethereum and DAO tokens. What if there was an &lt;strong&gt;arbitrage&lt;/strong&gt; between those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step two&lt;/em&gt; : Manually test the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If something "kinda works", I am on to something. All I had to do is execute all the steps manually and write down any fees, conditions or anything that should be documented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step three&lt;/em&gt; : Automate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This algorithm is not a high frequency trading algorithm. There is a considerable amount of time risk (which you can eliminate as we'll see later on) but what I did could be done manually. The problem is that I would have to spend all time in front of my computer, checking if there is an arbitrage condition and if there was, I had to act fast and without messing up. Oh and I had to recruit five of my friends to scale this up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I spent Presidents' Day writing a simple program that will replay all my manual steps. The program would crash and it was not more that 100 lines of code. This is the data collection stage where I see if there is an advantage that algorithms can give me. Advantages can be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that be automated and run 1000 of times per seconds or 1000 times in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that thinks faster than I can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Something that has no feelings to screw up my system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is at least one or more conditions met, I will start building and rewriting the algo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step four&lt;/em&gt; : All in&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am kidding and you'll see in a bit why risk management is super important in this business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; The Arbitrage &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's discuss a little bit about what this arbitrage was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is: "I wonder whether Kraken and Shapeshift have different prices for the same assets". This is a classic arbitrage case (Kraken and Shapeshift are "exchanges").
I could exchange DAO for ETH on Kraken, transfer ETH to Shapeshift, exchange ETH for DAO and send them back to Kraken and due to price inconsintencies I would end up with more DAO than I initially started! &lt;strong&gt;Risk-free money, the best kind of money&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make money as long as
ETHDAO from Kraken  * DAOETH from ShapeShift &amp;gt; 1 (+ fees + gas). Very simple formula, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every cycle, was a 2% to 10% return of my capital. After a while, I started hitting the limits of Shapeshift and I had to make this run in parallel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is &lt;strong&gt;what would you do if you had an algorithm that makes you 10% of your money every 20 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;? The stupidest thing you could do is put tons of money into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with the Greek word &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris"&gt;hybris&lt;/a&gt;, consider yourself lucky. Hybris is when you think that you are invincible, better than gods. And this is the biggest NO NO you can do in trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of weeks, theDAO was hacked. 160 million dollars were stolen (or should I say frozen?) and noone knew what was going to happen. For me, this happened, 10 minutes before boarding a plane to fly to New York. &lt;strong&gt;Hybris&lt;/strong&gt;. Or as people in the US say: &lt;strong&gt;Fuck&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was smart(lucky?) enough to have good risk management habits (thank you Forex). I never, ever, ever risk more that 2% of my capital even if it seems the best kind of deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the money were "restored" and I could withdraw/convert my DAO to Ethereum (but yes, I bought in-flight WiFi to keep up with what's going on).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This whole experience is a reminder that there are always things that you cannot predict. Things that you cannot control.
This was a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_risk"&gt;systematic risk&lt;/a&gt; and there was no way I could have seen it coming. Pushing buttons and building algorithms is not enough. Proper risk management and knowing when you need to take a chill pill is what can keep you in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the next post, I will post the whole algorithm and go line by line. I also plan to discuss a little bit more about theDAO and Ethereum. If you don't want to miss any of these and get some more additional info, feel free to sign up to the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt; where I talk about fintech, algorithms and the markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Machine learning and trading is a very interesting subject. It is also a subject where you can spend tons of time writing code and reading papers and then a kid can beat you while playing Mario Kart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nexts posts, we are going to talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize entries and exits. This and only this could make a ton of difference in your bank roll.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate position size (in case you don't like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion"&gt;Kelly criterion&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find possible correlation between different pairs (pair trading). I love the EURUSD vs GBPJPY correlation!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculate support &amp;amp; resistance lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what is Machine Learning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;img src="theme/images/stallone.jpg" class="" alt="" /&gt; --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(image from &lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3028414/how-facebooks-machines-got-so-good-at-recognizing-your-face"&gt;fastcompany&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning algorithms are algorithms where &lt;strong&gt;a machine can identify patterns in your data&lt;/strong&gt;. Yeap, it is that simple. For example, find all the animals in this photo and draw a box around them. Also, name that animal. Crazy I know. For trading as you can imagine it is pretty similar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Find how can I make money based on this chart and do all the trades.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;Then&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;wash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;underwear&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;don&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;t mix the colored with the whites&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for a machine to "learn", you need to teach it what is right or wrong (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning"&gt;supervised learning&lt;/a&gt;) or give it a big dataset and let it got wild (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"&gt;unsupervised&lt;/a&gt;). For identifying objects this is straight-forward but what about trading?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing with data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked around to see if there is any machine learning program that can identify S/R lines but to no avail. So I decided to write &lt;em&gt;the first machine learning program in python that identifies support and resistance lines in Python&lt;/em&gt;. Another first! Hooray!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can an algorithm identify these areas? Hoooooow?
Ladies and gents (and robots), let me introduce you to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_shift"&gt;MeanShift&lt;/a&gt;, an unsupervised algorithm that is used mostly for image recognition and is pretty trivial to setup and run (but also very slow). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that this algorithm will let me partition my data (forex ticks) into areas and then I can use the "edges" as support and resistance lines. Cool idea but does it work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler: &lt;strong&gt;It works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                     this.yAxis[0].addPlotLine({

             yAxis: {
                title: {
                    text: 'Exchange rate'
                },
                plotLines: []
            },
            series : [{
                type : 'candlestick',
                name : 'EURUSD Price',
                data : processedData,
                tooltip: {
                    valueDecimals: 2
                }
            }]
      });


    }})}})});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/ &gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyse around &lt;strong&gt;12 million&lt;/strong&gt; datapoints of EURUSD in 2014 and a couple of months of 2015. The resistance lines are placed automagically by a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really cool (and spooky) is that the algorithm pretty much nails it. &lt;strong&gt;NAILS&lt;/strong&gt; it hard. It gets really spooky when we are going to use the algorithm to identify micro-structures and start scalping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system is able to process any kind of timeseries data (stocks, forex, gold, whatever) and it  will render an html interactive chart (like the chart above) with your data and the machine generated S/L. The code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; so go crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's step through the code.
After you have your set of data you need to read them and clean them. Prepare for some &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt; magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read csv files with daily data per tick
df = pandas.read_csv(filename, parse_dates=[0], index_col=0, names=[&amp;#39;Date_Time&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Buy&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;],
                     date_parser=lambda x: pandas.to_datetime(x, format=&amp;quot;%d/%m/%y %H:%M:%S&amp;quot;))

# group by day and drop NA values (usually weekends)
grouped_data = df.dropna()
ticks_data = grouped_data[&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;].resample(&amp;#39;24H&amp;#39;).ohlc()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We drop the empty values (weekends) and then we resample the data to 24 hours candlesticks (ohcl). This makes it MUCH easier to plot. The grouped_data are the data that we will feed into the ml algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we prepare the data that we are going to use in the algo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;# use &amp;#39;ask&amp;#39;
sell_data = grouped_data.as_matrix(columns=[&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;])

# calculate bandwidth (expirement with quantile and samples)
bandwidth = estimate_bandwidth(sell_data, quantile=0.1, n_samples=12000000)
ms = MeanShift(bandwidth=bandwidth, bin_seeding=True)

# fit the data
ms.fit(sell_data)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the next post, we'll discuss how to make this work even better, discuss some very interesting results (can the algorithm actually predict about the future?) and start using it in our own trading.

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;strong&gt;THIS IS NOT TAX ADVICE.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is really surprising is that the majority of the requests in the newsletter are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use tools to assist Trading&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning to optimize trades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first two, I can understand. Everybody wants to be a better trader. I get it. But taxes? TAXES? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your lucky day. Forex taxes are super easy. Seriously. By default (this is called &lt;em&gt;Section 988&lt;/em&gt;), all your losses are going to offset your income taxes without the 3k limit per year. This is much better than stock trading where losses offset your capital gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens to gains? &lt;strong&gt;WHY DO YOU CARE? WHY?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The majority of the Forex traders lose money&lt;/a&gt; (I call it "paying tuition") the first year(s), so you are better off keeping it simple until you have a proven and consistent strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if you actually make a profit, you are taxed at the short-term capital gain (sometimes up to 40%).
The solutions to when you start making money are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opting out of Section 988 and get taxed under Section 1256 where 60% of profits are taxed as long term capital gains and 40% as short term (but now losses cannot offset your income). This is very good when you make money, very bad when you don't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start an LLC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people that just started experimenting with Forex and algotrading, I always suggest them to stay with Section 988 (the default) and when they start making some money (consistently) or they want to go full time, talk to me :) Seriously, there are so many things that you will start doing differently when you go from the "hobby" stage to "second income" to "full-time job" that there is no reason to over-optimize this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we talked about &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The "for-looper" backtester&lt;/a&gt; (as I love to call them). Now it's time to see some code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last time we talked about &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;The "for-looper" backtester&lt;/a&gt; (as I love to call them). Now it's time to see some code!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We said that we have something like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:::python
    for each element of readhistoricaldata(): 
        apply_strategy() 
        how_our_strategy_did()&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, let's load our strategy, load some &lt;a href="downloading-historical-forex-tick-data-and-importing-them-in-to-python-using-pandas.html"&gt;historical&lt;/a&gt; data, run our algorithm and print some results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/72428f085a41ddf85259.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to have my strategies in a JSON format that contains the name of the strategy and some specs (like how many pips for stop_loss or take_profit etc). That way, when we'll start using an event-based backtester, we can pass the strategy through a machine learning algorithm and try to optimize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next line is loading our data in. I know people don't like pickle and there other ways to load data (and we are going to talk about BColz at some point) but for now, just bare with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next line is self-explanatory. We pass the historical data to our algo and we get back some stats to print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's focus on the algorithm a little bit and we can discuss plotting etc at a later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The magic of the simple backtesting system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prepare to be amazed by how ridiculously easy to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/7792e71e9079f75ce9a5.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Short comings&lt;/em&gt;
What happens with this type of backtesting is that 
1. &lt;a href="building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;you'll probably make mistakes when you want to using the exact same algorithm&lt;/a&gt;
2. You won't be able to write a very complex strategy (at least that easy)
3. Very difficult to scale (compared to event-based)
4. You need to have your simulation and execution in the same language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT remember that this is the BEST and fastest way to start out and figure out how all these things work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, using other well-known backtesters in Python and adding graphs to our own!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below there is a list of strategies that I found online (or sent to me by traders that are on the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). I plan to update the list as I keep coming across to new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is that as we keep diving more and more into our algotrading system, I will show you how to code and deploy these strategies. I know for sure that most of them work with minimal changes. Worst case scenario, you'll have a system to test out your assumptions.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a backtest system is actually pretty easy. Easy to screw up I mean. Even though there are tons of excellent libraries out there (and we'll go through them at some point), I always like doing this on my own in order to fine-tune it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From all the backtesting systems I have seen, we can assume that there are two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The "for-loopers"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Event generators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we'll talk about for-loopers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "for-loopers" are my favorite type of backtesters. They are trivial to write and super fun to expand but they have some vital flows and sadly the majority of backtesters out there is "for-loopers" (ps: I need to find a better name for this!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How for-loopers work? Using a for loop (as you might have guessed). It is something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;each&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;readhistoricaldata&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;apply_strategy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;how_our_strategy_did&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very simple right? This is how one backtesting system works, that runs a momentum strategy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/jonromero/125cbca28067f0aefb2c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what is the problem? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very difficult to scale (horizontally) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needs lots of work to keep your apply_strategy() working on backtesting and production &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to have everything in the same programming language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's dive into these, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scalability&lt;/em&gt;. 
I was experimenting a couple a weeks ago with a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing"&gt;hill-climbing&lt;/a&gt; algorithm to optimize one of my strategies. It is still running. After two weeks. And I build uber-scalable systems for a living.
Why is it still running? You can use &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html"&gt;multiprocessing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://discoproject.org/"&gt;Disco&lt;/a&gt;, producer/consumer (using &lt;a href="http://zeromq.org/"&gt;ZeroMQ&lt;/a&gt;) or just threads to speed this up but some problems are not "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel"&gt;embarrassing parallel&lt;/a&gt;" (yes, this is an actual term, not one of my made-up words). The amount of work to scale a backtester like this (especially when you want to do same machine learning on top of it) is huge. You can do it but it is the wrong way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Production and backtesting in sync&lt;/em&gt;
This. The times I have been bitten by this. I can recall the lost trades where I was "hm, why I entered this trade?" or my old time favorite "WHY TRAILING STOP WAS APPLIED NOW?".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Story time: I had an idea in order to optimize my strategy, to run a backtester to see what would happen if I could put a trailing stop AFTER the trade was profitable in order to always secure profits. Backtesting worked like a charm at a 13% increase of earnings and &lt;em&gt;production lost every single trade&lt;/em&gt;. I figured it out after my algo lost $3400 in a couple of hours (a very expensive lesson).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the apply_strategy in sync is very difficult and becomes almost impossible when you want to do it in a distributed fashion. And you don't want to have two version of your strategy that are "almost" identical. Unless you have $3400 to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using different languages&lt;/em&gt;
I love Python. And Erlang. And Clojure. And J. And C. And R. And Ruby (no actually I hate Ruby). I want to be able to leverage the strength of other languages in my system. I want to try out strategies in R where there are very well-tested libraries and there is a huge community behind it. I want to have Erlang to scale my code and C to crunch data. If you want to be succesful (not only in trading), you need to be able to use all the available resources without prejudices. I have learnt tons of stuff from hanging out with R developers regarding how you can delta hedge bonds and visualize them or why Sharpe ratio can be a lie. Every language has a different crowd and you want as many people pouring ideas into your system.
If you try to have apply_strategy in different language then good luck with (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you convinced now? Well, I am not trying to convince you as for-loopers is a great way to run your initial tests. It is how I started and for many strategies I don't send them down to the pipeline. A "better" way (so you can sleep at night) is the event generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, sharing and discussing my simplest (but most successful) backtester!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before running any live algotrading system, it is a good practice to backtest (that means run a simulation) our algorithms. Have in mind that this doesn't mean that if your system is killing it for the last 5 years/months/days it will make a profit but it is a good indicator that you might be on to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are four things that we need to take into consideration when we do our backtesting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The quality of the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to load them efficiently &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to built our backtesting system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to have our backtesting and our live system share as much code as we can&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are going to focus on (1) and (2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Forex data, I am using &lt;a href="http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/"&gt;GainCapital&lt;/a&gt;. Their data are in the form of &lt;a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tick.asp"&gt;ticks&lt;/a&gt;. For a free source it is good enough. I used to use Oanda's historical data service but it seems that they moved it to a premium product. Too bad. Make sure that you use GainCapital's data only for experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any other kind of paid historical data (ETFs, stocks, options stc), I am using &lt;a href="http://eoddata.com/"&gt;eoddata.com&lt;/a&gt; (they also have some forex historical data but I haven't used them).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's download data for a week and experiment a little bit.
The link to the data is &lt;a href="http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/2015/11%20November/EUR_USD_Week1.zip"&gt;http://ratedata.gaincapital.com/2015/11%20November/EUR_USD_Week1.zip&lt;/a&gt; for the first week of November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to unzip the file
    :::python
    &amp;gt;unzip EUR_USD_Week1.zip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and you'll get a &lt;em&gt;25MB&lt;/em&gt; file named EUR_USD_Week1.csv. These are data for one week for one currency pair. You can imagine the amount of data you need to process for all currencies for the last five years (hint: a lot!). But don't worry, we are going optimize this. For now, let's open the file and inspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;EUR_USD_Week1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;lTid&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;cDealable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CurrencyPair&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateDateTime&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateBid&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;RateAsk&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650058&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:06.490000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103380&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103770&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650061&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:06.740000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103760&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650072&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:07.990000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103390&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4464650083&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;EUR/USD&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2015-11-01 17:00:08.990000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103400&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.103750&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the things that we care about is the RateDateTime, RateBid and RateAsk. As you can understade each line has a timestamp and the how much was the price to buy or sell. Formats downloaded by other services are pretty similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to load these data into Python but the most preferable when it comes to data slicing and manipulating is using &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;.
We can always use the &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html"&gt;csv&lt;/a&gt; library to load data (and it might be faster) but we need to do some optimizations and processing first that as you will see it is pretty easy with pandas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great tool to load TONS of GBs pretty efficiently and very fast is using &lt;a href="http://bcolz.blosc.org/"&gt;Bcolz&lt;/a&gt;, covered in a much later post (or you can read a preview if you have signed up in the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manipulating data using Pandas&lt;/em&gt;
The data we downloaded are in ticks. Unless we are building an UHFT (ultra high frequency trading) algorithm, it is much more efficient (memory, storage and processing-wise) to
"group" these ticks into seconds (or minutes or hours depending on your strategy). This will make our download scale down from 25MB to just &lt;em&gt;35KB&lt;/em&gt; which translate to HUGE performance and memory benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's group all these data in 15 minutes. How? Time to fall in love with resample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;parse_dates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index_col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;names&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Tid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Dealable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Pair&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;DateTime&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Buy&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Sell&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_parser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# let&amp;#39;s erase the columns we don&amp;#39;t need&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Tid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Dealable&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Pair&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# group every 15 minutes and create an OHLC bar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;grouped_data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;resample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;15Min&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ohlc&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resampled the dataset looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;| DateTime            | Buy | Open | Buy | High | Buy | Low | Buy | Close | Sell | Open | Sell | High | Sell | Low | Sell | Close |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
| 2015-08-02 17:00:00 | 1.09706    | 1.09821    | 1.09706   | 1.09735     | 1.09752     | 1.09853     | 1.09740    | 1.09762      |
| 2015-08-02 17:15:00 | 1.09731    | 1.09825    | 1.09731   | 1.09769     | 1.09762     | 1.09843     | 1.09758    | 1.09808      |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is called OHLC (Open High Low Close) bar for every &lt;em&gt;15 minutes&lt;/em&gt;. You can see now that the ticks are grouped in 15 minute segments and you have the highest and lowest point that the price reached during these 15 minutes and also the open/close for buy and sell. Pure gold! Not only you have all the information you need but now it is extremely fast to load it. You just need to save the data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;::&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# save to file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;grouped_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_pickle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;-OHLC.pkl&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then you can reuse this 35kb file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can write a simple momentum algorithm that checks if there was a huge movement the last 15 minutes and if that was the case, let's buy. We will dive into this in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the code as always on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading/blob/master/post4/create_OHLC.py"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before building any algotrading systems, you need to know how to trade manually. What that actually means is that you need to lose money on your own before blaming the machine. As simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let's talk about Foreign Exchange or Forex as the cool guys call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, why do we choose Forex for algotrading? Why don't we become millionaires trading like everybody else? Why not just buy Tesla, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter and hope for the best (PS: please read the legal outro at the end of this blog post before buying any stocks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy answer. You cannot win (or lose) money fast enough by buying stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex has a nice (or terrible, depending on which side of the coin you are) thing called &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leverage can be 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:1000 depending on how suicidal you are or how sketchy your broker is (don't worry, we'll talk about brokers in the next post). Let's see an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to place a trade of $1k. The logical thing is that in order to buy something that costs $1k, you need to have in your account $1k, right? Nope. You can always get a loan. Oooooooor: Enter leverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a 1:100 leverage, we can place a trade and "control" $1k with just $10. For those that failed at math (don't be ashamed, I am one of you), $10 x 100 (leverage) = $1,000.
That means you can trade big and win big! Actually 100 times more &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt;! The catch is that you can actually go 100 times more &lt;em&gt;small&lt;/em&gt;. Let's have another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just got my bonus ($1k) and I want to play on Forex.
Without any leverage, I can buy 1,000 Forex units that cost $1 (by the way, there are no Forex units but we'll talk about this later). 
How many units can I buy with 1:50 leverage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you answer if 100,000, you did something wrong. The answer is 50,000 ($1,000 x 50 leverage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it. One of the reasons that we are doing Forex, is because you can &lt;a href="http://jon.io/building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;lose&lt;/a&gt;/win big. We'll get back to leverage when we start placing trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three more exciting reasons actually that are even more awesome (dare to say awesomer?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forex (almost) never sleeps. The markets are open ALL DAY, six days per week. To be more exact, there is not one market but four and they are overlapping providing the "all day" effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forex is very volatile and there are tons of money moving around (more than 5 trillion &lt;em&gt;per day&lt;/em&gt;). Crazy right? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No fees on trades. You don't pay $10 per trade like you are doing with stocks. Here you pay &lt;em&gt;the spread&lt;/em&gt; which is just a fraction of a cent (again, we'll talk about this in another post).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these reasons (leverage, all-day, volatility, fees) make Forex the most exciting platform to build and deploy your algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up next, Forex brokers. How not to be scammed before even writing a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have more feedback, ping me at &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;jonromero&lt;/a&gt; or signup to the &lt;a href="http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb"&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Find the posts &lt;a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am planning to cover the basics of how to build your own trading platform, write your own strategies and go on vacations while electrons are making you money. Or zeroing your account. Either way, it is going to be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of the examples are going to be in Python even though there might be parts in Erlang and I'll try to keep it as easy as it can be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk now about what the final product will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a system where you will be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simulate your strategy (this is called &lt;a href="http://jon.io/building-a-backtesting-system-in-python-or-how-i-lost-3400-in-two-hours.html"&gt;backtesting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execute your strategy without supervision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alert you via sms/email for trades and errors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be scalable and trivial to deploy new updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to run even from your home (from a raspberrypi for example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume this is going to be a total of 20 chapters, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a system similar to the one that I am running the last year and includes a UI, sms alerts, backtesting pipeline, continuous delivery and all the cool stuff that us geeks love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code will be on &lt;a href="https://github.com/jonromero/forex_algotrading"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and if everything goes well, I'll wrap it up in a book for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a scenario:
I have lots of data sitting as CSV on my hard-drive and I want to process them. Not query them. Process them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would be really interesting is to be able to define (dynamically) a schema like that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;defschema&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;EURUSD&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tokenizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;.split&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; the mapping is done here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;columns&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|time|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|open|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|high|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|low|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|close|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;|volume|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.
First of all, a "tokenize" function. Each dataline is tokenized based on a function. Do you want regex? Something more complex? You are free to write anything you like. I really hate frameworks that you must write a complex regular expression or use a compicated system just to tokenize a line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, tokenize returns a list of data that are mapped to "columns".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the interesting stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write scripts like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;|close|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.45&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;place-order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:buy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;place-order&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ss"&gt;:sell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has enormous amount of data (volume)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These data are coming extremely fast (velocity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to consider multiple resources when you are building your strategy (variety)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My definition of BigData is that you have volume-velocity-variety information &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; you need to react on it right now (realtime). It is one of the main reasons why I don't like Hadoop (ok, the other is because I don't like Java:). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forex is the best place if you want to start playing with BigData. You have (at least) one data channel, hitting you with data, you need to keep running algorithms on this stream (sometimes doing correlations up to a week) and you need be able to respond very fast. If a garbage collector kicks in or if you need to grab data from a database (even if this DB is in memory - long live Redis) then you will have issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the reason why most of the "trading" databases have all their data in the same memory space and have custom languages doing the analysis (like &lt;a href="http://kx.com"&gt;Kdb&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the inspiration for LDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millions of data sources (mobile phones), hitting your database and calculating/updating for each one of the requests thousands of counters and running all sorts of algorithms. Per request. In realtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let's face it. The vast majority of users/companies will never have millions (or even thousands) of requests hitting their servers. That's why I started a new opensource database with codename: HybrisDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HDB has the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to install (no moving parts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple to use (pre-defined dashboards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will be perfect for the 99% of users/companies but not for the 1% like Facebook or Google (sacrificing Enterprise features)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept is to have a dashboard, to watch indicators going on/off and then (maybe) connect to a system to place an order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like an interesting cool hobby project and I still try to decide between using Erlang or Clojure for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ping me on &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt; if you have any ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
