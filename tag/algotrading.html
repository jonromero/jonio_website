            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>Time to talk about brokers, how to place a trade programmatically and most importantly how not to get scammed.</p>
<p>This is the third part of the series: <a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html">How to build your own algotrading platform</a>.</p>
<p>A broker is nothing more than a company that lets you trade (buy or sell) assets on a market through their platform. What is very important for algotrading is: 
1. The broker offers an API in order for us to place orders
2. You can have a demo account to run your staging environment and experiment
3. The spread is as small as possible</p>
<p>In our case, we don't really care about spread as we won't be doing High Frequency Trading any time soon.</p>
<p>Even though brokers are regulated, there have been incidents in the past couple of years, were brokers folded due to certain conditions. Be <em>very</em> wary if 
1. There are no reviews of the broker on the internet (or most of them are bad)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the broker offers you some crazy leverage (like 1:200)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the broker seems to be in a very strange country</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What could happen is that when you start making some money and you wouldn't be able to pull them out. Seriously. Super stressful situation.</p>
<p>But let's switch to a happier note which is opening an account and placing our first programmatic trade!</p>
<p>I am using <a href="http://www.oanda.com/">Oanda</a> as a broker (I am not affiliated with them) and they offer a pretty decent API, libraries on github and a free demo account. </p>
<p>Go and open a free <a href="https://fxtrade.oanda.com/your_account/fxtrade/register/gate">fxTrade Practice account</a>.</p>
<p>After you get your free demo account, go to your profile 
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757245/jonio/oanda.png" /></p>
<p>and you can change your leverage (switch it to 50:1) and then go back to your <Manage API Access>. There you can find your API key which we are going to use in our system to place trades. <em>MAKE SURE YOU DON'T SHARE THIS KEY</em>.</p>
<p>The code for this is and all other posts is on my [github])https://github.com/jonromero/Forex-algotrading) and you can install it and run it pretty easily.</p>
<p>The code is straight-forward. We connect to Oanda, to a practice account with our token </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">oanda</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">oandapy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">API</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">environment</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;practice&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                   <span class="n">access_token</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">OANDA_ACCESS_TOKEN</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>response = oanda.get_prices(instruments="EUR_USD")
  prices = response.get("prices")
  buy_price = prices[0].get("bid")</p>
<p>and we are asking the prices (bid/ask) for the pair EUR_USD. </p>
<p>We print the buy price and then we place a <em>market</em> trade. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span> <span class="s">&quot;Buy at&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">buy_price</span>
<span class="n">trade_id</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">oanda</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID</span><span class="p">,</span>     <span class="n">instrument</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;EUR_USD&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">units</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">,</span>
                  <span class="n">side</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;buy&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                  <span class="nb">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;market&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Super easy. Don't worry about what EURUSD is or how many units we are buying or what a market trade is. For now, we have placed our first trade from our laptop and we are going to build our own API to place trades. Exciting stuff!</p>
<p>You can read Oanda's documentation <a href="http://developer.oanda.com/">here</a> to see what else you can do with their API.</p>
<p>Coming up next, connecting to a real <em>LIVE</em> algotrading system, running from my RaspberryPI at home. You'll be able to see the (almost) final program running and we'll talk more about Forex and strategies.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>This is the second part of the series: <a href="how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html">How to build your own algotrading platform</a>.</p>
<p>Before building any algotrading systems, you need to know how to trade manually. What that actually means is that you need to lose money on your own before blaming the machine. As simple as that.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about Foreign Exchange or Forex as the cool guys call it.</p>
<p>First of all, why do we choose Forex for algotrading? Why don't we become millionaires trading like everybody else? Why not just buy Tesla, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Twitter and hope for the best (PS: please read the legal outro at the end of this blog post before buying any stocks).</p>
<p>Easy answer. You cannot win (or lose) money fast enough by buying stocks.</p>
<p>Forex has a nice (or terrible, depending on which side of the coin you are) thing called <em>leverage</em>. </p>
<p>Leverage can be 1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:200, 1:1000 depending on how suicidal you are or how sketchy your broker is (don't worry, we'll talk about brokers in the next post). Let's see an example.</p>
<p>We want to place a trade of $1k. The logical thing is that in order to buy something that costs $1k, you need to have in your account $1k, right? Nope. You can always get a loan. Oooooooor: Enter leverage.</p>
<p>If we have a 1:100 leverage, we can place a trade and "control" $1k with just $10. For those that failed at math (don't be ashamed, I am one of you), $10 x 100 (leverage) = $1,000.
That means you can trade big and win big! Actually 100 times more <em>big</em>! The catch is that you can actually go 100 times more <em>small</em>. Let's have another example.</p>
<p>I just got my bonus ($1k) and I want to play on Forex.
Without any leverage, I can buy 1,000 Forex units that cost $1 (by the way, there are no Forex units but we'll talk about this later). 
How many units can I buy with 1:50 leverage?</p>
<p>If you answer if 100,000, you did something wrong. The answer is 50,000 ($1,000 x 50 leverage). </p>
<p>There you have it. One of the reasons that we are doing Forex, is because you can lose/win big. We'll get back to leverage when we start placing trades.</p>
<p>There are three more exciting reasons actually that are even more awesome (dare to say awesomer?).
1. Forex (almost) never sleeps. The markets are open ALL DAY, six days per week. To be more exact, there is not one market but four and they are overlapping providing the "all day" effect.
2. Forex is very volatile and there are tons of money moving around (more than 5 trillion <em>per day</em>). Crazy right? 
3. No fees on trades. You don't pay $10 per trade like you are doing with stocks. Here you pay <em>the spread</em> which is just a fraction of a cent (again, we'll talk about this in another post).</p>
<p>All these reasons (leverage, all-day, volatility, fees) make Forex the most exciting platform to build and deploy your algorithms. </p>
<p>Coming up next, Forex brokers. How not to be scammed before even writing a line of code.</p>

            </h1>
            <div class="article-content"> <p>That's it. Every week, I get at least 10 DMs on twitter asking on how to experiment with algotrading, Forex and portfolio analysis and I've decided that it's time to do something about it.</p>
<p>Update: Find the posts (here)[how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html].</p>
<p>So, I am planning to cover the basics of how to build your own trading platform, write your own strategies and go on vacations while electrons are making you money. Or zeroing your account. Either way, it is going to be fun!</p>
<p>The majority of the examples are going to be in Python even though there might be parts in Erlang and I'll try to keep it as easy as it can be. </p>
<p>Let's talk now about what the final product will look like.</p>
<p>We are building a system where you will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simulate your strategy (this is called backtesting)</li>
<li>Execute your strategy without supervision</li>
<li>Alert you via sms/email for trades and errors</li>
<li>Be scalable and trivial to deploy new updates</li>
<li>Being able to run even from your home (from a raspberrypi for example)</li>
</ol>
<p>I assume this is going to be a total of 20 chapters, give or take.</p>
<p>That is a system similar to the one that I am running the last year and includes a UI, sms alerts, backtesting pipeline, continuous delivery and all the cool stuff that us geeks love.</p>
<p>All code will be on github and if everything goes well, I'll wrap it up in a book for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>I have like three chapters almost done, so if you want early access just ping me at - <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jonromero">jonromero</a>.</p> </div>
