Title: My Story

Since I was a little kid in Athens/Greece, I was fascinated with building things. Actually I loved breaking things down and then trying to build them up again to see how they work - which most of the times ended up with a lot of broken experiments.

I had an unhealthy obsession with programming because I could mess up all I wanted in my own little universe of variables and conditions.  

Serial Entrepreneur, Angel Investor, Awarded Software Engineer. Specialized in turning "impossible" to "possible".

I have a thing for anything that is competitive (from sports to trading) and I love talking in front of big audiences.
