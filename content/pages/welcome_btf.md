Wait! You are not done yet! Read below! 


Every day- starting tomorrow - you’ll be getting emails from me—and each of them covers one simple idea and an action item.

To make sure you get my emails, I highly recommend you to do this immediately.

If you’re a Gmail user — find my emails and please move me to your primary inbox.

You can find my email easily [by clicking here](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/me%40jon.io) 

And then move me to your Primary inbox.

For mobile: In the top right corner of the app hit those 3 dots, click "Move to" then "Primary."
For desktop: Back out of this email then drag and drop this email into the "Primary" tab near the top left of your screen.


Enjoy
