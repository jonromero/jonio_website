LittleGods are 10,000 unique characters with names and story generated using Machine Learning (GPT-2). Each one of them has unique characteristics and you can buy and sell them on OpenSea. 

You can see all of them below. Clicking on any of them, takes you to a full description.

> Update: Little Gods haven't been deployed yet on the blockchain. Help out with the debugging (looking for strange names, making suggestions) and get a Little God for free

Full code, videos and tutorials about how LittleGods were made will be available to owners of at least five little Gods. That includes the ERC-1155 contract with commentary, the GPT-2 name and description generation and the procedural generation of images. You should be able to build your collection in under 2 hours.
