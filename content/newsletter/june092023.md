👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ Purple cow

This is me (obviously) wearing my usual attire.

I call it the "Purple Cow" attire. 🐮

[The Purple Cow](https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cow-New-Transform-Remarkable/dp/1591843170) is one of my favorite books, and it is about marketing. ✨

The whole idea is that traditional marketing (especially paid) doesn't work anymore, and you need to stand out.

The story is about how the author was driving across a field full of cows, and suddenly, one was purple. He stopped and saw tons of people around the purple cow because ... well, it's a purple cow!  

That doesn't mean obviously that you should be a clown or an offensive idiot to stand out. I mean, you can if that's your thing, but I prefer self-expression.

How can you use the "purple cow" effect?

🙂 I believe we are all awesome. Yes, especially **you**.

But because we are bogged down by everyday life, rules, and "shame" from childhood, we stop being ourselves.

We stop having fun. We stop trying to be different - we actually avoid it.

Let's change that.

Wear something you wouldn't wear. An extravagant hat. A crazy T-shirt. Pink shoes! 😎

Try to break the mold a little bit day by day and unleash your inner purple cow.  

Because, at the end of the day, we are all purple cows. 🔥

## 2/ Running Olympus

I am running Mountain Olympus 🏔️ in two weeks. And I am terrified. 😵‍💫

And I love it. ❤️

As part of my [conference](https://jon.io/vaim), which I hope you've signed up already, we are running Mountain Olympus.

Why? Because last year my friend and co-organizer of VAIM [Anni](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annipanagiotopoulou) said, "Why don't we run Mountain Olympus because it sounds like fun"?

And it did sound like fun!

Until the training started. 🏃

And it is actually fun (what a twist!) because **if you are not in pain, are you really alive?**

Do the things that make you feel **alive**! 🔥

## 3/ Blackbird

✈️ It doesn't matter if you are a pilot or not; you are going to love the stories (especially the "speed check" one) [of the SR-71](https://www.thesr71blackbird.com/Aircraft/Stories/sr-71-blackbird-speed-check-story).

This was the fastest plane ever made (it was closer to a spaceship 🚀 than a plane) and was never shot down (obviously, it could outrun missiles).

The crew had to wear spacesuits and go through astronaut training.

When it was on the ground, it was leaking fuel because the frame was loose - it was made to be tight only when flying at incredible speeds.

I love engineering stories 🛠 as I get to see how smart we can be when we focus on a single goal.

Have you ever heard about **SR-71**? 📥

## **4/ Next-gen QR codes**

This is the next-generation QR Code.

**QR codes**, short for Quick Response codes, are two-dimensional barcodes that, until recently, were super boring and blunt. But a few days ago, some guys on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/141hg9x/controlnet_for_qr_code/) posted some [AI-generated art that was actually a camouflaged QR code](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/redditor-creates-working-anime-qr-codes-using-stable-diffusion/). 🤯  

Imagine having a super cool artistic poster on your wall that is actually the wifi password for guests. Or an amazing poster that leads to your website. 🤩

What else would you do with that? 📥
