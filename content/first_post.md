Summary: New blog for geeking out

I haven't blogged for a while and I think that I needed I new (virtual) home for my rants.
This place is brand new (and white!) and it is going to be awesome!

I don't know what will happen with my previous domain ([emotionull](http://jon.is.emotionull.com)) but I think it might be the new home for a new (underground) social network for traders. We'll see.

My hobby project right now, is a new opensource trading platform (for the first time not focused on HFT) and some experiments around a super fast, vertical scaling, full adhoc queries database (exactly the opposite of [LDB](http://www.bugsense.com/about/bigdata) I've built at [BugSense](http://www.bugsense.com)). I'll keep you posted.

Good times people!
