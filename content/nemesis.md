Title: I am your Nemesis

This is something I've read on reddit and with some changes, it is a hell of a motivation fix.

Hi. I'm your competition & whether you like it or not, you're being compared to me and guys like me. I don't have noticeable flaws, emotional hangups, or needy tendencies. 

While you are playing video games or watching TV, I am out doing sports. While you're picking out your outfit, I'm doing crunches so I can take my clothes off. While you're at your job, I'm at my career. While you're hanging in your parents basement, I'm traveling around the world. While you're questioning whether or not she likes you, I've already found out. When you're pining over the one that got away, I'm making her laugh but walking away because she's not that interesting. 

Do you hate me? **You should**.

Because I'm the guy she wishes your text was from. I'm the guy that makes you feel 2 inches tall. I am the guy that gets your promotion and goes on long weekends while you work on holidays.
I'm the reason that women have their emotions guarded and I'm the guy you'd punch out if you weren't such a little bitch.

If you can't find enough motivation to change your life just by thinking about all the great things you can experience out there, you can find that motivation by thinking about me, messing around with the feelings of the love of your life and then not calling her. You've got to be better, work harder, and do more to be her hero.

Or you can just skip your workout today, stay home tonight & jerk off. Please do, because that makes it so much easier for me and all the other assholes like me.
