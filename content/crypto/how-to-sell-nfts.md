Five months ago, I decided to sell my first NFT, a piece of cake for my birthday, on my NFT platform. Since then, I sold more than 100 NFTs, sometimes for celebrities, other times for smaller creators or for my own conference (which sold out three times).

I talked with every big Hollywood talent agency and I saw them selling less than my birthday cake. 

These are the things I've learnt that will help you get started.

## The platform doesn't matter

When you go to Amazon, do you go to browse on their homepage what is new to buy or you are going there to search something specific?

**This is exactly** how people buy NFTs. 

People don't go on OpenSea and say "oh this little monkey from a creator I never heard before is on sale for 10 Ether,  I need to buy this right now". 

> 99% of NFT sales happen by sending people **directly** to an NFT. 

You have higher chances on selling NFTs **outside** of OpenSea/Rarible/etc as your buyers won't get distracted by random NFTs. 
See all the projects that make **consistent** sales. Hashmasks, Mekaverse, bla. Custom pages for drops. Of course, if you want resales you need to 
be on OpenSea but don't be delussional thinking that anyone could find your NFT in this (well) sea of NFTs ;)

And you would know that this is true if ...

## You need to buy NFTs to understand how to sell NFTs

Every single NFT I bought was because someone from my community recommended that I should check it out. And all NFTs that made me money where bought outside of OpenSea (ok, I made some Ether by also trading on OpenSea).

To me, trying to sell NFTs without ever buying an NFT is like trying to be a soccer coach without knowing soccer (Ted Lasso is the exception. Also he is a fictional character). 

I am not saying go and spent all your momey buying random NFTs. But you need to get involved in projects and communities, see how things work and understand how and why people make money and you have only 4 views in your NFT.

The biggest example is having influencers trying to sell to their followers and making "pocket money" because their followers had NO idea how to setup a wallet or what Ether is. I guarantee you the most talent agencies with their infinite connections and budgets have ZERO idea how to make any NFT sales (that at least beat my birthday cake).

> Having more followers or being famous means shit in the Metaverse

Which brings us to my next point

## Community

If you are following me on social media, you would know by now that I am a true Metallica fan. I am the person that had travelled 4 hours to go an see Metallica performing in a Drive-in or fly to San Franscisco. I am a **true fan**. 

Community is the biggest asset and creator and company has. It cannot be copied. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be bought. 

> Followers != Believers

The random integers you see on your social profiles that represent how many "followers" you have are just a vanity metric. How many of them are actually going to **travel** to see you? How many share your values?


To sale NFTs (and sale consistently) you need people that share your values. An excellent example is "..." an amazing creator that has a very small and active community. You should try and copy something that is true and sustainable and not obsess with becoming bla bla. Noone became Metallica in a day (or Justin Bieber if that's your thing).

I'll do another post about how to build and maintain your community because there is so much stuff and tools to cover in just one post.

## Price

Most of the creators I met, have no idea how much they should price their first NFTs. If you don't have a ballpark 



## Would you buy your NFT?

## What should I do if I already have a big following?

## Should I sell in a different chain?

## I am a famous "traditional" artist? Would I sell?
No

## I am a photographer
No



















This year (2021 for the visitors from the future), I run my first own conference: ["V as in Metaverse"](https://jon.io/metaverse2021).
It didn't have thousands of attendees (because there is a thing called [COVID-19](how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country)) but it had [NFTs as tickets](how-nfts-will-change-events-and-why-mark-cuban-is-a-genius), tons of sponsors and happened in the best place you can be for the summer - Greece. If you don't believe me ask [Jeff](https://greekreporter.com/2021/07/04/jeff-bezos-vacation-greece/) or [Justin](https://greekcitytimes.com/2021/06/28/justin-bieber-and-his-wife-hailey-getaway-to-greece-mykonos/).

> You can read the story how (and why) this conference started right [here](https://jon.io/organizing-a-crypto-conference-in-europe-in-less-than-a-month).

Consider this as a guide on how to do your own conference or a huge meetup. And maybe bug [Gary](https://twitter.com/garyvee) to use this brand new [NFT-as-tickets](create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute) technology. 

Feel free also to [check some highlights](https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3OTU5MDE1MTM4NDYwNjk2?story_media_id=2597301977270937775_35696786) on my Instagram. Here we go.

## Took me 1 month to organize it and execute it (while I was vacationing in Greece)

It is the same effect as in weddings. If you have one year, it will take you one year of planning. If you have 1 week, it will take you one week of planning. Not relevant but my wedding took me 1 week from planning to execution. Some people call this (the effect, not my wedding) the [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).

Obviously, you either need to cut corners **or** have an epic team helping you out. I am blessed that I had an amazing community helping out, making intros to sponsors, even helping with coordination and finding us space. I love you all!

## Use NFTs as tickets

I built my own NFT ticketing system and used it, front-running Gary here (sorry Gary).
If you want to learn more about the technology and how to create your own NFT tickets (it is trivial and free!), check this post ([create your own NFT tickets for free in less than 1 minute](create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute)).


For "V as in MetaVerse" I wanted people to experience "The Metaverse" and it was important for me to have everyone buy NFTs and use a cryptowallet. If we used "normal" tickets it would be lame (Bitcoin 2021 in Miami - I am looking at you). So I did the thing I know really well: destroying my vacations by writing smart contracts.

The videos from the conference (we had a professional team from LA flying to Athens to document everything - thank you [N&T](http://www.northandtouth.com/)) are going to be available to people that attended the event and own the NFT. How awesome is that!

> Take away: Practice what you preach. A crypto conference without using crypto is hilariously lame.

## More than 3200 subscribers in 2 weeks

Do you want to build a community? Be yourself and have fun. 
I was posting content [non-stop](https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/) and I was even posting videos while I was on vacations about how the conference was progressing. Of course we had tons of media sponsors and TV/Radio channels that kept pushing on.

> Take away: Be helpful, add value and keep pushing. Don't bullshit.


## COVID-19 strict restrictions (everyone must be tested or provide tests)

This was the most challenging part. Checking tests, wearing masks and not being able to have more than 50 people in one space. We could have done the conference in an open space but screen glaring and no WiFi was a no-go. Other than that, once you were inside the space (and your [NFT ticket was scanned and verified](create-1000-nft-tickets-for-free-in-less-than-1-minute)), you were safe.

> Take away: Minimize red-tape and restrictions and if necessary, add them in the beginning of the experience.

## Do more of fun stuff - less of boring stuff

Podiums and slides are terrible. Please stop doing this. We copied the format from my podcast [Silicon Beach](https://www.wearesiliconbeach.com/) and all the presentations were fireside chats (or as I like to call them "firechats"). **EVERYONE** loved them and most of the audience stayed for 6 hours listening to the speakers. On a Saturday. In Greece. During the summer. Yes, it was **that** awesome.

Being able to talk with world class speakers is more interesting, engaging and the audience enjoys it way more. Do more of fun stuff, less of boring stuff.

## I got epic speakers flying in from the biggest companies on the planet

People flew from LA, NY, Monaco, London just to participate in my conference. I am forever grateful to them because this was a blast.

## We gave 2500 euros (~$3000) to participants of the hackathon (yes, we even had a hackathon)

Some of the teams never wrote a smart contract before. But they did their first transaction on the blockchain and figured out how authentication works, how off chain solutions might be faster but have issues, what are these "gas fees" etc. Some teams came by train (6 hours) from Thessaloniki and kicked ass.

## Don't overthink it

My motto [built to fail](https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail) has never failed me.

## Start small

This wasn't the first time I was organizing an event. I have organized hundreds of events in San Francisco, Europe even in Japan and I was even the organizer of a Google User Technology Group (GTUG) so I had a good idea of how to run an event. Of course going from organizing small meetups to organizing a conference under **my** own brand was a huge leap of faith but you'll never know unless you try :)

## Was it easy?

Oh no. Not easy AT ALL. I was crazy stressed and during the conference I skipped eating because I was the host of the firechats. But we had so many speakers and not a lot of time and I had to squeeze everyone in. 

But it was very gratifying. Most people from the conference went for food afterwards and I had the clarify of fasting **plus** being around friends and intelligent people in my favorite place in the world. Awesome feeling.
But the 29 days before that were not fun :)

## Things that didn't work out

1. We had 14 more sponsors that wanted to participate (and they have already signed up for next years' conference!) but I didn't have time to on-board them, collect payments and get their images and websites. I know it sounds easy but I had tons of other things that HAD to happen and I couldn't outsource this. So, one thing I should do is make the process of onboarding automated or at least easier to be done by someone else than me. Definitely a "fail" moment.

2. Swag. Our swag provider didn't deliver on time. So we had no swag for the conference. Buuuuuut I am going to send swag to everyone that got a ticket. 

3. Duration. It should have been a 3-day conference. 7 hours firechats are brutal. In my defence, I never thought we'll have all these amazing speakers flying to the event.

4. Food. Damn you COVID! We were not allowed to bring food to the conference so in my "built-to-fail" fashion, I started going to "private lunches" with each team separately. Money was not an issue (thank you again sponsors!) but having to eat 5 times in *Day One* and 0 in *Day Two* was not balanced.


If you made it this far, thank you and I would love to hear what you think. Send me a message on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX) (or an email) - I always respond to all emails.
