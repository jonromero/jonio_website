*This is the another post of the series: [How to build your own algotrading platform](how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html).*

What is a good algotrading system without some neat strategies to deploy?

Below there is a list of strategies that I found online (or sent to me by traders that are on the [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb)). I plan to update the list as I keep coming across to new ideas.

The concept is that as we keep diving more and more into our algotrading system, I will show you how to code and deploy these strategies. I know for sure that most of them work with minimal changes. Worst case scenario, you'll have a system to test out your assumptions.   

Here is the list (and please send me any other strategy that you think it should be included):


Coming up next, sharing and discussing my simplest (but most successful) backtester!

If you have more feedback, ping me at [jonromero](http://www.twitter.com/jonromero) or signup to the [newsletter](http://eepurl.com/bGbOnb). 

Legal outro. This is an engineering tutorial on how to build an algotrading platform for experimentation and FUN. Any suggestions here are not financial advices. 
If you lose any (or all) you money because you followed any trading advices or deployed this system in production, you cannot blame this random blog (and/or me). Enjoy at your own risk.
