The most important thing that matters in trading is knowing when to "enter" and "exit" a trade. Fortunes are made and lost in a blink of an eye by those who don't have a *plan* (and sticking to it) .Having a system that let's you *on average* perform, is the only way that you might make some money/have fun. Maybe.

Now, some preliminary information in order to give you the context of how is to trade in Forex.

96% of the people that play on Forex end up losing and quitting. Why? Easy answer. They treat trading like gambling. That comes with along "I have a gut feeling about this", "ha, i knew it this would happen", "I'll buy some Amazon stocks and I'll sell them in a year" or my personal favorite "revenge trading".
