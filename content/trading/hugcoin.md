This is a departure from our [how to build your own algotrading platform](how-to-build-your-own-algorithmic-trading-platform.html) series but I think it is interesting and fun.

** What HugCoin is **

It all started after experimenting building a DAO that works like the democracy in Ancient Greece. Automated taxation, basic income and tons of other cool stuff.
While optimizing the DAO code, I had some cool ideas that I wanted to try out. One of them ended up in HugCoin.

HugCoin a cryptocurrency I made, running on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning it is a coin I made mostly for fun. The code is tight so you can experiment pretty easily.


** Features **

One coin = One hug. You can send AS many hugs as you want. You will never run out.
Whenever you send a hug, you get to name the hugged person and his/her name will always exist in the public chain. Awesome right?

Let's see how many huggers are out there!

Legal outro. This is an engineering tutorial on how to build an algotrading platform for experimentation and FUN. Any suggestions here are not financial advices. 
If you lose any (or all) you money because you followed any trading advices or deployed this system in production, you cannot blame this random blog (and/or me). Enjoy at your own risk.
