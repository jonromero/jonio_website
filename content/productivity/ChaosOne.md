Title: A product management system based on Anarchy
Tags: productivity
Status: draft


I've been thinking a new way for product management where the emphasis is placed on two things:
1. Everyone gets whatever he wants from a pool of tasks
2. Data are collected all the time (data-driven system)

*Roles*

Continious stream of tasks (many times outside of the Sprint).

Points (velocity?) are calculated based on what task you complete and when. Data collection about efficiency, team coordination and what tasks you like the most / you are good to deliver.

That system gives feedback about how every individual performs, how the whole team performs, while consuming tasks that are placed in a pool.

PS: have to think, should workers know about the points for each task?
