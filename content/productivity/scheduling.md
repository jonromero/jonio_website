## Total Recall

I was reading a new book that talks about Arnold’s life, called [Total Recall](https://www.amazon.com/Total-Recall-Unbelievably-True-Story/dp/1451662440) and he mentioned how he books appointments and generally manages his day and time. And when I say Arnold, I mean [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator) [Arnold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_career_of_Arnold_Schwarzenegger) in case you [didn’t understand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger#Mr._Olympia).

His trick is pretty simple and he’s been doing it for more than 20 years. Here it goes:

> Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn’t have a weekly or monthly schedule.

That means that Arnold doesn’t schedule ANY **appointments** in the future. Do you want to talk to him? You can do it later today and that’s it. Or if it is super important, you can talk to him **right now**.

That way Arnold can focus on what is **important to him** and **focus**, instead of having his whole life dictated by Google Calendar.

And now we are getting to the part where you say to yourself: I cannot do that! I have people to meet, business meetings, skype calls etc etc.

## The part where you say bullshit to yourself

I am a Founder (currently on my fourth Startup) and an Angel Investor and my schedule for at least three weeks in advance is sold out. And I am not bragging because **this sucked**.

> That means that if I (and the Governor of California) can do this, you can do it.

Two weeks ago, I decided to give it a try and not schedule meetings for more than 3 days in advance.

For some interactions, it was flawless.

> Hey, I want to ask you for a new crypto strategy, how is your schedule next week?

> Hello there! I try not to schedule any meetings that far into the future in order to focus on what’s important right now. Do you have time to meet tomorrow?

> Sure! Let’s do it

.

> Hello Jon, we are still trying to figure out how this integration will work. Maybe setup a meeting at the end of the month?

> Hello Andy, I try not to schedule meetings that far into the future so let’s talk tomorrow or around the end of the month to set something up.

> Oh, ok. Let me see if we can do something this week.

Sometimes it didn’t work AT ALL.

> Hey man, we plan to have a Founder’s meeting in a couple of weeks from now. Are you coming (I need to confirm seating).

> Yo, I suppose but can we please talk next week again?

> It’s this bullshit TimFerris-y thing that you are doing, right?

>Tim Ferris is a fake Entrepreneur, I am doing the Schwarzenegger thing

## Will I keep doing it?

Week 3 is almost over and again my life is dictated by Google Calendar but only 3 days in the future (faint hoooraaaay).

**The huge difference is managing my energy levels** (which maybe is more important than managing time) because I can arrange meetings based on what I feel working on right now and focus on what is important for me and the company.

Check back with me in a couple of weeks ;)
