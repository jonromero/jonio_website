Last year I posted an article about how to [find the things that you love](the-joy-journal). This year I collected more metrics and I came closer to the things that make my whole day better. This is definitely not a silver bullet so what makes **me** happy might not work for you. And just like that, you got your first tip: 

## People are different and you should give Î¶ero fucks

Everyone has a personal life journey and 99.99% it is an epic one. Seriously, I've **never** met a person that doesn't have an awesome life story. I met a lot of people thinking that their lives are boring but "the grass is always greener" and all that stuff. The trick here is

## You are not a "world critic"

## Finding what you love is hard. Very hard

## If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO

## We are prisoners of our own fantasies 

Being in Startups for a good part of my life exposed me to many different environments and to different skills. 

Just in 2020 I learnt how to shoot my own videos (poorly), edit them (poorly-times-2), build better financial models for AgentRisk, built products (that make money) faster and how to build a bigger audience that matters **to me** and acquired tons of other skills. The bad(?) thing is that I acquired some skills that I DEFINITELY didn't want. More on that later.
