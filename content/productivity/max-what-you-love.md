Title: Maximize what you love, minimize what you hate

Being in Startups exposed me to many different environments and to different skills. 

Just in 2020 I learnt how to shoot my own videos (poorly), edit them (poorly-times-2), build better financial models for AgentRisk, built products (that make money) faster and how to build a bigger audience that matters **to me**. The bad(?) thing is that I acquired some skills that I DEFINITELY didn't want. More on that later.

Last year I posted an article about how to [find the things that you love](the-joy-journal). This year I collected more metrics and I came closer to the things that make my day better. 

## Lords of Summer

One of the reasons that I moved to Los Angeles is because it is summer all year long. I love [the sport of the Gods](addictive-design-using-unpredictable-rewards) but this summer I was also involved in a [huge humanitarian project](how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country) where I architected and coded a whole system from scratch.  

And I freaking loved it. 

I really missed writing code and building products that **just work** instead of making sure I don't upset the SEC. Yes, having your own wealth management company and managing millions using algorithms might sound exciting but after a while it is soul crushing. 

Things I *love*:

1. Building products
2. Helping people
3. Surfing

Things I *hate*:

1. Highly regulated areas that you cannot innovate fast
2. Helping [only wealthy people](https://agentrisk.com)

## Weekend Warriors

My mood this year was way better than last year (this is also attributed that I am a positive person in general and to my support network - I love you all btw) but there is a distinguishable uptick on Saturdays.

Saturdays are my "project" days. The days where I get to build small experiments to try ideas. Experiments that I have zero expectations that will ever get any traction but I've seen a couple of them getting a couple of thousand of followers. This blog is also one of these experiments by the way.

Fridays were my "meeting" days. I used to pack all my meetings on a Friday. Now I dedicate 3 hours **per week* in meetings that I won't learn something new or have an insane fun time. I plan to bring this down to 30 minutes per week by outsourcing everything to my (kickass) EA. 

Things I *love*:

1. No expectation experiments

Things I *hate*:

1.  Meetings

## If it is not a HELL YEAH, it is a HELL NO

This year I started focusing more on "life design" (I'll post more about **life design** in the following weeks). 

Life design helps you build your day, week, month and year in a way that creates a perfect flow for you. It usually requires you to reprioritize your whole belief system but the main gist is if you are not ecstatic about something, you shouldn't do it. This new navigational framework is making ripples on the rest of my life as old milestones (like raising money for my company or even selling it) become swamps that will slow me down.

So, here you have it. Everything that I learnt using data for a second year.
