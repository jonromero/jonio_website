> Why *not* being focused is awesome

One of my biggest resolutions for 2020 was to guard my time and energy like Cerberus - the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld.


The main reason is that I need more time for my projects. Besides [AgentRisk](https://agentrisk.com) that takes most of my time, I have tons of other projects that compete for my attention.

Some of them are small - like releasing [my book](why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands.html) in a printed version.

Other projects are on-going - like using **petri dish for my biohacking experiments** or learning Russian. And others are much bigger - like the soon-to-be-released TV Show or improving my drawing skills.

Long story short, I could do 16 hours non-stop every day for 6 months and I wouldn’t be done with half of my projects.

But the goal is not to be done. I enjoy the process. I literally enjoy having many hobbies and learning new stuff. **And it only makes me better at everything**.

## Jack of all trades, master of none
The saying “Jack of all trades, master of none” is criminally stupid. It wasn’t even applicable when the whole of humanity was working on the fields and we had to specialize.

>I know how to seed.

>I don’t need to learn about business. I don’t need to learn about the weather.

>I don’t need to know about trading.

>I don’t need to know about economics. No need to know about computers.

Ticket straight to unemployment.

## Reroute to remain
Take your “idol” and see how he/she knows more than their craft. **Way** more. Usually, they merge ideas from different fields and create something new. **Jack of many trades, Master of Anything**.

Any intelligent creator understands that you need to control the whole creative process and that means that you have to know way more than your main craft. The most successful musicians not only have their own record company but they have expanded to other fields totally unrelated to their profession. And they kick ass.

As my friend Ice-T said in one of my episodes:

> If you are good at something, you learn how to get good at something else.

Whenever you acquire a new skill **at any level**, your chances of success are multiplying x2. Or something like that.

I understand why people get intimidated when they hear about new projects. Usually, they struggle with just their everyday job and they cannot understand that to grow they need to be cross-pollinated by different skills in different fields.

Don’t get me wrong, being focused is **an amazing thing** if you are a drone, want a 9-to-5 job and have zero creativity. But we are already suppressed enough in our lives.

Let your inner creator make a mess. That’s the only way we grow.
