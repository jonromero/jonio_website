> Is all that we see or seem. But a dream within a dream?

Last night the craziest thing in my life happened.

Twice.

While I was sleeping, I had a dream. You know, the kind of a dream where things make **ZERO** sense when you wake up and try to explain in to people.

In that dream, I was with a friend, driving a car and trying to get away from someone. I don't remember why, I don't remember who.

I decided to go up the hill and take a quick turn **right** before the cliff. 

The view was fantastic. I think it was Athens/Greece but I've never been to that place before. And that's where things start becoming strange.

After waking up, I remembered that **I've been to that same hill before** - in ANOTHER dream! And (get ready for this):

> This made me remember ANOTHER location that was part of my dreams for a very long time.

Imagine this. I remember that I know this hill from another dream and all of a sudden I can remember tons of other dreams that happened to another location - that (again) doesn't exist!

## The dream place

To get to my dream place, you need to pick "the other road". I don't know what that means but in my dreams I don't always decide to go there.
It has an amazing sea to swim in and nice backroad with a backery and a windmill. 

And I remember that in all my dreams, going to this place was absolutely normal.

It seems that for whatever reason, my subconscious (is this one word?) decide to creeate a new **map** and something trigger my conscious(ness?) to access it. 

And now I ask you. Suddenly I can remember tons of dreams that happened to these locations. Does that mean that dreams are also stored in our memory? Do they mean something or our brain (mind?) gets bored from time to time?

Have you ever had a similar experience? I'd love to hear more about it.
