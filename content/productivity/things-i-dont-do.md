2026 is here and I have so many epic projects in the pipeline. This is the list I have created in
Obsidian of things that I stopped doing in 2025 and going to expand in 2026.

1. Having calls with new people when there is no clear plan of discussion or I don't care for the subject
2. Responding to messages from people I don't know/care about
3. Postpone things (like vacations) because "I'll do it next year"
4. Flying economy 
5. Renting/buying the cheapest one because "I don't really need the best one"
6. Not hiring people to help me scale my businesses faster and enjoy life more
7. Thinking that something about my health (gym, tests, vitamins etc) is "expensive"
8. Optimize - I only try to maximize 
9. Assume that people know what they are doing - they usually just want to deliver. Be more engaged, control everything until the process is clear

## Having calls 

I hate online calls. They disrupt my whole day and put me out of my creative flow. I do them only
when they can further my mission (like [my fund](https://jon.io/the-jon-vlachogiannis-fund) or any other projects I am working on).

I love in person meetings that's why I meet tons of people during my runs. If you want to chit-chat, run with me!

## Responding to messages from people I don't know/care about

Keanus Reeves said: If someone insists that 1+1=5, I won't argue. 

## Postpone things 

If I like it, it goes on my [Big Ass Calendar](https://thebigasscalendar.com/) to do it as soon as possible. Awesome things should not be postponed.

## Flying economy 

I don't drink. I don't do drugs. I don't gamble. LET ME HAVE MY BUSINESS CLASS.
 
Flying economy undoes all the good stuff I do all year long for my body. And my mental health.

## Renting/buying the cheapest one because "I don't really need the best one"

Got burnt so many times by this. So.many.times. I want it? I buy the best. 

## Not hiring people to help me scale my businesses faster and enjoy life more

I like working with smart people. And I think money should move around. But there are still stuff I just like building on my own (it's my craft and it is fun!)

## Thinking that something about my health (gym, tests, vitamins etc) is "expensive"

I have gone to the extreme with that (thanks to Bryan Johnson). From tons of blood tests to full body MRIs to the best trainers to expensive gyms and private clubs to the best shoes. Money well spent.

## Optimize - I only try to maximize 

The kiss of death for many Entrepreneurs (especially from Europe). Because I am not a trust fund baby, I learnt to make money from zero. But to grow to the next level, you need to change your ways. 

## Assume that people know what they are doing - they usually just want to deliver. Be more engaged, control everything until the process is clear

OH THE TIMES I'VE BEEN BURNED BY THIS. From construction to software development to making movies. Trust but verify. 

What are the things YOU don't do anymore? I'd love to hear about them.
