It was 2015 and my Startup had just [got acquired](https://www.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAJJC) by [Splunk](https://splunk.com), a multi-billion dollar Company in the Silicon Valley.

I was in Athens/Greece at that point and for the first time, I didn’t have to think 24/7 about customers, bugs and scaling the company. That was someone’s else problem now.

With all that free mental cycles, I decided to focus my energy to something new (at least for me): a book. Or as I’ve been saying since then

> THE BOOK

I pitched [What I do With My Hands](https://whatidowithmyhands.com/) to my friend, [Anastasia](http://www.asiomou.com/) and she loved the idea.

Ok, I **loved** the idea - she just played along.

## These 10 little Celebrities
We met at my Airbnb in Athens (oh yes, I was staying in Airbnb all over the world for the last three years - hashtag StartupLife) and we came up with these cool(?) things that you can do with your hands. Why? Seriously, I don’t know why.

After that, the book spent **five years** in my Trello todo list, taunting at me, laughing at me and promising eternal glory and recognition. The main reason was me, over-engineering the whole process.

I had to find the perfect layout, website, page, intro everything.

And as we all know, being a perfectionist is how you get things done.

## Ship the fricking book!
2019 has been a shifting year for me. I reevaluated so many things in my life but more importantly I decided that taking yourself seriously is the worst thing it can happen to your personal growth.

I decided to go back to basics and start creating more. And then some more. And then add on that. And the first step was releasing that book.

My friend [Vivi](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikve), made sure that it renders correctly on even the oldest of Amazon Kindle and then fought with the Amazon’s layout creator.

I used a free template for the website, got the domain, hosted the website on Github Pages and here you go. Available on Amazon and (in the next couple of weeks) available as a coffee table book. You’ll be able to read it soon in all the hipster coffee places in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

## So, now what?
I don’t intend to make money from the book - I keep running “free book” promotions on Amazon but I can do only five days every 90 days. If you want to read it and don’t want to spend $2 on Amazon, send me an email and I’ll send you a PDF version.

I found out that whenever I do “soul projects” expecting returns or outside validation I hate the process and I end up getting bored. I know, it is kind of obvious but I keep forgetting.
