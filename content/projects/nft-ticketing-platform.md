In 2021 a crypto event took place in Miami: Bitcoin2021. One of the things that stood out to me
was that the tickets were not available to buy with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrencies. 

So, I decided for my annual conference ["V as in MetaVerse"](https://jon.io/metaverse2021) to use NFTs are tickets. 

In this tutorial you will see:

1. How to create as many NFT tickets as your want, **for free**, in less than a minute
2. The NFT tickets will be automatically stored in IPFS
3. The NFT tickets are 100% NFTs (ERC721) - they are available automatically on OpenSea after someone buys them
4. You won't need any special software to "check-in" people - just your phone's camera
5. You can charge and get paid in Ether for your event just by entering your wallet address
6. You can have a **mailing list** with everyone that bought your ticket (makes support way easier)

In this tutorial, you won't see:

1. How to change the image of the NFT (and text) after someone checked-in
2. How to airdrop NFT gifts to your buyers
3. How to use the API to create a service to sell tickets

We'll cover all of these in a next tutorial - so don't forget to subscribe.

## How can I create NFT tickets?

Creating NFT tickets is as easy as creating simple NFTs. It is just one checkbox. One click. Right here.

But let's go into detail. 

Creating an NFT on [OMGDrops.com](https://omgdrops.com) assumes that you have an approved creator's account. If you don't, drop by the [discord](https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX) and I'll give you one. Sorry we are a small team and we are trying not to drown in support requests.

After that, you don't need ANY money to create NFTs. No Ether. You can have a zero balance crypto wallet. No need to pay for proxies (I am looking at your OpenSea) or to mint an NFT (I am looking at your Rarible). Your buyers can buy your NFT in pure Ether (no need to convert to WETH, DAI or whatever) and with the lowest gas fees out there.

But let's see how really easy to create an NFT.

You upload your image/gif/movie whatever, write a small description and then you click **unlockable content** and **NFT ticket**. You press "Done" and well ... you are done! Everyone can buy your sparkling, awesome, majestic NFT for your briliant event.



## What happens when someone buys the NFT ticket

When someone buys your NFT ticket, it is immediatelly available on OpenSea for trading.

That means that the buyer can put it on auction, fixed price do whatever they want. Oh and you always get to keep 10% of the resale price ;)

But they can also "unlock it". By clicking "unlock content" and putting their email, they will get a QR code. This QR can be used to check-in at the event but more importantly they can save it as image in their mobile. No need for internet during the check-in.

The people at the door have a couple of choices on how they want to scan the tickets. The easiest is with their phone camera. They will be redirected to a page that says whether the ticket is valid or if **it has been resold**. 

The next choice (which is my favorite) is using the scanner from their cryptowallet. In that case, the door scanner can "check-in" the user (so noone else can use the ticket after this). The door scanner or the issuer has also the ability to change any metadata including the NFT image - we call these dynamic NFTs.

In addition to that, all NFTs with unlockable content require the email address of the buyer so you can integrate this with your CRM (still unsure whether we are going to keep this feature). 

Let's recap:

1. You created your tickets **for free** in 5 seconds and are even [stored automatically on IPFS](/images/ipfs.gif)
2. You checked-in everyone securely without going crazy and without any special software
3. You have their wallet address and you can airdrop them any free NFTs you want (as a thank you)
4. You have a mailing list with your NFT buyers

If you want to play around and break the system, feel free to jump to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/eNWGH9GSMX). I would be more than happy seeing this solution being used to all real crypto events.

Update: We also have an API if you are interested in building the first NFT ticketing platform!
