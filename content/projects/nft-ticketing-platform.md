In 2021 a crypto event took place in Miami: Bitcoin2021. On of the things that stood out to me
was that the tickets were not available to buy with Bitcoin or any other crypto. 

So, I decided for my annual conference ["V as in MetaVerse"](https://jon.io/metaverse2021) to use NFTs are tickets. Just like Gary Vee but awesomer. Way awesomer. 

[Here is how it went](I organized my own conference like Gary Vee in 30 days) if you like

## How can I create NFT tickets?

Creating NFT tickets is as easy as creating simple NFTs. It is just one checkbox. One click. Right here.

But let's go into detail. 

Creating an NFT on OMGDrops.com assumes that you have an approved creator's account. If you don't, drop by the discord and I'll give you one. 

After that, you don't need ANY money to create NFTs. No Ether. You can have a zero balance Metamask wallet. No need to pay for proxies (I am looking at your OpenSea) or to mint an NFT (I am looking at your Rarible). Your buyers can buy your NFT in pure Ether with the lowest gas fees out there. After toouting my own horn for a paragraph, let's continue.

You upload your image/gif/movie whatever, write a small description and then you click unlockable content and NFT ticket. You press "Done" and well ... you are done! 

## What happens when someone buys the NFT ticket

When someone buys your NFT ticket, it is immediatelly available on OpenSea for trading. But they can also "unlock it". By clicking "unlock content" and putting their email, they will get a QR code. At a later version this QR will also be sent to their email. This QR can be used to check-in at the event but more importantly they can save it as image in their mobile. No need for internet during the check-in.

The people at the door have a couple of choices on how they want to scan the tickets. The easiest is with their phone camera. They will be redirected to a page that says whether the ticket is valid or if **it has been resold**. 

The next choice (which is my favorite) is using the scanner from their cryptowallet. In that case, the door scanner can "check-in" the user (so noone else can use the ticket after this). The door scanner or the issuer has also the ability to change any metadata including the NFT image - we call these dynamic NFTs.

In addition to that, all NFTs with unlockable content require the email address of the buyer so you can integrate this with your CRM (still unsure whether I am going to keep this feature). 

Let's recap:

1. You created your tickets **for free** in 5 seconds
2. You checked in everyone securely without going crazy and without any special software
3. You have their wallet address and you can airdrop them any free NFTs you want (as a thank you)
4. You have a mailing list

If you want to play around and break the system, feel free to jump to our Discord. I would be more than happy seeing this solution being used to all real crypto events.
