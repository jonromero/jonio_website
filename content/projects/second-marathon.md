First of all, in case you don't know, [even though I said it before](https://jon.io/i-run-a-marathon-and-it-was-epic): 

> I hate long distance running. It is stupid, boring and not fun at all.

But who doesn't want to run TWO Marathon (and a Half Marathon) in one year?

The only reason I did that, was because I wanted to run the Authentic/Classic Marathon in Athens/Greece. And it was an amazing experience running the same route (from the city of Marathon to Athens) to the iconic stadium.

And who doesn't like flying for a week to Greece and back to LA?

## Training

This time I did **less** training (yes, I have an EVEN better program) and went **way faster in a more difficult** (20 miles hills!) distance. Keep reading, I'll share everything. 

First of all, some stats:

1/ I run more than half marathon every week, for a whole year!

You need a lot of training to run a marathon (actually two)

2/ Instead of running 500 miles in training (the recommended), I run 300 miles (even less than the previous time - 320). But I did something different that I think is vital.

The day before my long run, I always did a 6 mile run. That way, I was "pre-training" my legs and the total milage for two days was a little bit bigger. This helped A LOT.

3/ This Marathon felt easier. I recovered faster and the whole experience was fun.

It helped that I had friends during the recovery!

4/ I gained fat, lost muscle

Running sucks as we have established. My next project is competing in a body building competition and it was impossible to make it work. Running needs a lot of energy. Take the **L** and do some strength training.

5/ [This is my training program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OIjTL3fHO_lxoR9dRxNFt_QyjwKsLKANRX6CoziH2oU/edit?usp=sharing). Worked for me!

6/ I had a CRAZY injury on my hills, a week before the race. But everything worked out

7/ Second year wearing Nike Vaporfly. Don't buy anything else.


I intend to keep running with Venice Run Club and the "Wind like the Run" every Wed and Sat and maybe a half Marathon for the fun of it but I think I am done with the full Marathon. The training is just brutal.

Next goal, body building! Follow along!
