Welcome to my fund, a non-for-profit fund that helps people become better Entrepreneurs, scientists, thinkers and change the world.

It's a test ground for a Super Intelligence Foundation so things might change all the time so bear with me.

Every 6 months, I'll fund people for different things. 

This round is called **The Super Intelligence scholars program**.

Expect rough corners as my motto is:

> Moving fast and stumble instead of not doing anything at all.

## What I offer

1. Air tickets to the US

2. Hotels/ Airbnbs for you to stay as long as the conference is.

3. A $500 per diem (so you can eat and drink and have fun)

4. A chance of internship at the top companies or universities in the planet

5. A chance to change the world


## Eligibility for the Super Intelligence scholars program

1. You are Greek and you have a paper or idea that you want to present in the US.

2. You love algorithms, A.I, Super Intelligence and biocomputing and you want to build the next big thing.

3. You are a student and you need funding to present your work.

4. The conference you want to attend is epic. In the future I'll have a list of conferences and if you have any ideas PLEASE SHARE THEM with me. For now, I'll just approve them as they come.

5. You are NOT a company, you are NOT presenting a product, you are presenting a paper or an idea. There are discussions to do this for companies and include funding but for now we are focusing on students.


## What I ask in return

Nothing :) Ok, maybe wear our swag at the conference and a selfie?

Just be a normal person and make your future self proud. [I was helped making it to the Silicon Valley and my life has changed forever and I think my present self if pretty happy](http://localhost:8000/pages/my-story).
