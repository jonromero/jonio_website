Welcome to the **Jon Vlachogiannis Fund**, a nonprofit supporting entrepreneurs, scientists, and bold thinkers who are building ideas that shape the future and change the world.

This is an experimental platform for a future Superintelligence Fund, and it will evolve as I learn and iterate. Thank you for bearing with me.

Every year, I will provide funding to support people working on different ideas and projects.

This round is called **The Superintelligence Scholars Program**.
 
Expect rough corners as my motto is: 

> Move fast and stumble rather than not do it at all.

## What the Program offers:

1. Round-trip airfare to the United States

2. Hotel or Airbnb accommodations for the full duration of the conference

3. A $500 per diem to cover meals, local transportation, and incidentals

4. Access to internship opportunities at leading companies and universities worldwide


## Eligibility for The Superintelligence Scholars Program

To be eligible, applicants must meet the following criteria:

1. Eligible applicants must be a student or researcher based in Greece and have an accepted paper, poster, or workshop submission at a recognized conference advancing artificial superintelligence, machine learning, biological intelligence, or alignment research. 

2. Preference will be given to applicants with papers accepted at widely recognized, high-impact international conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, BIO International, or equivalent venues in their respective fields. Read below for a curated list of approved conferences. Suggestions of strong interdisciplinary conferences and workshops are welcome.

3. Eligible applicants must be an individual, not a company. Eligible applicants must be presenting a paper or an idea, not a commercial product. Future programs may support companies, this program is currently focused exclusively on students and researchers.


## What I ask in return

Nothing :) Ok, maybe wear our swag at the conference and a selfie?

Just be a good human and make your future self proud. [I was once helped on my own journey to Silicon Valley, and it changed my life. My present self is pretty happy — and I hope this support helps shape your story too.](https://jon.io/pages/my-story). 


## Epic Conferences

We love epic conferences where the future is being built. If you are presenting a paper or an idea at a world-class venue, we want to help you get there. Here's a sample list of conferences held all over the world. Keep in mind only conferences in the US are approved at this time.
