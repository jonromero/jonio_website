## The epic saga of why I created HeyFire

How I 20x my networth by being annoying
The 3+1 rules that helped by 20x my networth in a decade.

This is the story of how I get to self-fund all my projects, take vacations wherever, whenever and for as long as I want and spend my day working only for myself. 

After I sold my first company, I ended up with a lot of money. And by **a lot** I mean the right amount of money that a geek like me needs to never work again and just build cool stuff all day long.

The first thing I did was go to one of the huge/famous/glamorous Wealth Managers and see how to invest my newfound wealth. Have in mind that in that moment I had zero idea how to invest in something outside of myself. I was a 100% Startup guy.

The Wealth Manager (let's call him Andrew), asked me a couple of questions, had me fill up some papers and they showed me a portfolio that had a bunch of mutual funds. 

Without having any idea that my question would open a can of worms, I asked:

> How this portfolio was created? 

Andrew said that the proprietary algorithm they had, took as input my age and "other" parameters and created this perfect portfolio for me. 

Oh Andrew, oh Andrew. You should **never** mention "algorithms" to an Engineer and not expect a baraz of follow-up questions.

> How many people have the exact same portfolio? Can I talk to them?

> If I came a year ago, would the algorithm suggest to me the same portfolio? 

> Is this the most optimal portfolio in terms of fees and performance?

> Why all the assets in the portfolio have the name of your company?

and the final nail on the coffin: 

> Has your own personal portfolio being generated by the same algorithm?

I saw that Andrew dying a little bit inside as each question was echoing around his office.

To be fair, Andrew tried to be diplomatic but never answered any of these super simple questions and in case you are wondering here are the answers:

> How many people have the exact same portfolio? Can I talk to them?
-- No idea, no you cannot.

> If I came a year ago, would the algorithm suggest to me the same portfolio? 
-- Yes, it will suggest the exact same portfolio because our portfolio were built years ago. The "algorithm" doens't update them dynamically

> Is this the most optimal portfolio in terms of fees and performance?
-- No, not even close.

> Why all the assets in the portfolio have the name of your company?
-- We get kick backs, we get to charge you more fees and you cannot leave with paying crazy taxes

> Has your own personal portfolio being generated by the same algorithm?
-- Of course not

As with all my big life decisions, I told him to give me a couple of days to do my research and I'll get back to him.
And oh boy. Research I did. 

For the next 6 months I read scientific papers, theories, I run simulations, I build small apps and talk with a lot of advisors and I extracted "three plus one" simple rules:

1. Build a simple diversified portfolio but NOT too diversified
2. Keep track and look for similar assets with the lowest fees
3. Rebalance, tax harvest and reinvest
4. You make money when the market goes down

I started applying these rules to all my other investments like real estate and Startup investing and I came up with the IMOE principles. And Oh.My.God. How epically they work. 

## The〈√〉IMOE principles.

1. Innovate Relentlessly: Always look for new ways to achieve and exceed your ambitions.
2. Measure Rigorously: Quantify progress and setbacks alike to understand and steer your journey.
3. Optimize Continuously: Constantly seek to improve yourself in all aspects of life.
4. Embrace Discomfort: Challenge yourself regularly to grow beyond your comfort zones.

I apply the "IMOE" principles in everything I do - from optimizing my health to training for a marathon to my personal finances.

Note: IMOE stands also for "In my on experience" The symbol〈√〉- is the radical symbol. IMOE was this 〈Δ〉so the V is like an inverse D.

## 20x my networth and failing

With this knowledge, I built a Wealth Management platform that did somethings pretty well and some other things extremely bad.

In terms of investment, the portfolios and the management where OUT OF THIS WORLD. Even during a period like COVID, our portfolios made 16% (our return of investment per year, was on average 18% - across all our customers).
I had 95% of my wealth managed by my system - I was one of our biggest customers and I saw with my own eyes my net-worth going up when the IMOE principles are applied. 

I remember that taking into account Time IRR, I destroyed most US VCs and all of European VCs in terms of returns. Sorry, I actually wanted to say obliterated. 

But all good stories come to an end and on the business side eventhough running a Wealth Management company is a very profitable business, it is not an exponential return game and that meant that I had to shut down the company.

## HeyFire

Obviously, I am still using the knowledge I gained 

I tried many (all?) portfolio/wealth trackers and all of them had three issues. 

1. Not actionable data
2. Needing my bank information to connect
3. The companies were funded by VCs

Let's go through all of this issues, one by one.

## Where is the action?

Building and managing portfolios is not rocket science. It's literally simple mathematics. You can optimize your portfolio with
some very simple algorithms and make some **pretty pretty pretty** good money. You just need to be consistent. 

With HeyFire, you'll get recommendations for tax loss harvesting, rebalancing and other optimizations you can apply to your portfolio.



I know because I was managing portfolios for HNWI for more than 5 years with my own Wealth Management company (yes, I had to )

The best way to learn a new technology is to make something with it. 

I signed up for a [48 hour competition](https://gen48.runwayml.com/ ), sponsored by RunwayML, Coca Cola and YouTube and I created a short movie in 5 hours. These are the things I learnt.

## Good stuff

I created a "movie" in 5 hours and I spent **$50** while being amateur in movie making. 

For someone like me, to have a similar result without A.I, they would need to spend at least $3k and 48 hours. At least.

If someone spent more time and knew what they were doing, just by using A.I they could had made a short movie that the non-A.I equivalent would have been at least $50k and 1 week of work. 

What I am trying to say is that the benefits are exponential once you start using A.I.

Now, for the **bad news**. 

## Bad stuff

It is EXTREMELY difficult to create scenes with the same character. If you watch my movie, you'll see that the main character keeps changing. 

It also very difficult to create exactly the shots that you want. I kept changing my script because I couldn't get the right shots.

Check out some videos [I posted on twitter](https://twitter.com/jonromero/status/1716224203148648709). Hilarious stuff.

A.I is terrible when it comes to human faces that have to show emotions. Just terrible.

Creating scripts with A.I is laughable. Plot holes, unimaginative stories, confusing endings. 

Having said that, I plan to create a big movie just to try more technologies (like lip syncing) as I believe the space is going to be huge.
