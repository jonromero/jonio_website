## The epic saga of why I created HeyFire

tldr: I sold companies, made money, saw that the financial sector is a joke, wrote the best piece of software to help you become free.

This is the story of how I get to self-fund all my projects, take vacations wherever, whenever and for as long as I want and spend my day working only for myself. 

After I sold my first company, I ended up with a lot of money. And by **a lot** I mean the right amount of money that a geek like me needs to never work again and just build cool stuff all day long.

The first thing I did was go to one of the huge/famous/glamorous Wealth Managers and see how to invest my newfound wealth. Have in mind that in that moment I had zero idea how to invest in something outside of myself. I was a 100% Startup guy.

The Wealth Manager (let's call him Andrew), asked me a couple of questions, had me fill up some papers and then showed me a portfolio that had a bunch of mutual funds. 

Without having any idea that my question would open a can of worms, I asked:

> How this portfolio was created? 

Andrew said that the proprietary algorithm they had, took as input my age and "other" parameters and created this perfect portfolio for me. 

Oh Andrew, oh Andrew. You should **never** mention "algorithms" to an Engineer and not expect a barrage of follow-up questions.

> How many people have the exact same portfolio? Can I talk to them?

> If I came a year ago, would the algorithm suggest to me the same portfolio? 

> Is this the most optimal portfolio in terms of fees and performance?

> Why all the assets in the portfolio have the name of your company?

and the final nail on the coffin: 

> Has your **own** personal portfolio being generated by the same algorithm?

I saw that Andrew dying a little bit inside as each question was echoing around his office.

To be fair, Andrew tried to be diplomatic but never answered any of these super simple questions and in case you are wondering here are the answers:

> How many people have the exact same portfolio? Can I talk to them?
-- No idea, no you cannot talk to any of them.

> If I came a year ago, would the algorithm suggest to me the same portfolio? 
-- Yes, it will suggest the exact same portfolio because our portfolio were built years ago. The "algorithm" doesn't update them dynamically

> Is this the most optimal portfolio in terms of fees and performance?
-- No, not even close.

> Why all the assets in the portfolio have the name of your company?
-- We get kick backs, we get to charge you more fees and you cannot leave with paying crazy taxes

> Has your own personal portfolio being generated by the same algorithm?
-- Of course not

As with all my big life decisions, I told him to give me a couple of days to do my research and I'll get back to him.
And oh boy. Research I did. 

For the next 6 months I read scientific papers, theories, I run simulations, I build small apps and talk with a lot of advisors and I extracted "three plus one" simple rules:

1. Build a simple diversified portfolio but NOT too diversified
2. Keep track and look for similar assets with the lowest fees
3. Rebalance, tax harvest and reinvest
4. Make money when the market goes down

I started applying these rules to all my other investments like real estate and Startup investing and I came up with the IMOE principles. And Oh.My.God. How epically they work. 

## 20x my networth and failing

With this knowledge, I built a Wealth Management platform that did somethings pretty well and some other things extremely bad.

In terms of investment, the portfolios and the management where OUT OF THIS WORLD. Even during a period like COVID-19, our portfolios made 30% (our return of investment per year, was on average 17% - across all our customers).
I had 95% of my wealth managed by my system - I was one of our biggest customers and I saw with my own eyes my net-worth going up when the IMOE framework is applied. 

But all good stories come to an end and even though running a Wealth Management company is a very profitable business, it is not an exponential return game and that meant that I had to start looking for an exit.

## Selling another company

After my Wealth Management company, I started another one by mistake (that's a different story) and sold it in about a year. 

With this new infusion of cash, I needed better tracking. Better management. 

I tried many (all?) portfolio/wealth trackers and all of them had three issues. 

1. Not actionable data
2. Needing my bank information to connect
3. The companies were funded by VCs

So, I decided to build the most important Financial Independence platform out there. 

## HeyFire

Building and managing portfolios is not rocket science. It's literally simple mathematics. You can optimize your portfolio with
some very simple algorithms and make some **pretty pretty pretty** good money. You just need to be consistent and **not stupid**.

With HeyFire, I am focusing in giving you the tools to build the best portfolio for you, share it with people you trust for feedback or use battle-tested portfolios as a base for yours. 

You'll get recommendations for tax loss harvesting, rebalancing and other optimizations you can apply to your portfolio.

You'll get the best support available out there. 

A community that prioritizes growth and knowledge sharing.

Deep podcast and deep dives into how people manage their wealth and trying to decouple our self worth from our net-worth.

And a platform that wants to help people live free instead of trying to make VCs richer.

This is a gargantuan effort and it will take time. But IMOE it worths it.
