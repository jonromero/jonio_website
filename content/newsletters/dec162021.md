So many things happened last week and I cannot wait to share them with you.

1/ This week I gave a talk about DAOs at the "Proof Of Consciousness", a Los Angeles/Venice DAO. [Here are the slides](https://bit.ly/jondao11) and I recorded an epic video - hopefully to be released this week. It explains once and for all what a DAO is and how you can start working for one.

2/ Last week I posted about the DAO that we started - KaramelaDAO. We are building it in public - meaning that everything that we do is documented and shared. Now you can learn from our mistakes and see the whole process.



We are on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karameladao) and below is the first designs for our NFT. If you want to get involved (we have tons of bounties!), [drop by our Discord](https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA).

3/ Last week we didn't have a [weekly pitch deck reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo) but oh, this week you are in for a surprise.



[Donald Trump has started a new media(?) company](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-says-hes-launching-a-new-media-company-with-its-own-social-media-platform) that hopes to replace Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Disney+, Amazon, Stripe, Google Cloud, AWS and Azure. I am not kidding.



Someone sent me his pitch deck and ... (you know where this is going right?).



[I am reviewing Donald Trump's new pitch deck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcVWM00QjeY), without getting political, as I review every other single Startup. A lot of things to be learnt from this.



Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, **DO IT NOW**.

4/ The last couple of months, my schedule grew back to its unsustainable form. Despite having outsourced almost **everything** that is possible to be outsourced, I got involved again into to many epic projects. On top of that, there is a never-ending backlog with pitch deck reviews plus tons of other content waiting to be released.



Time for a clean up.



Let me introduce you to $Victory coins (yes, I am working on the name).



You collect $Victory by reading my newsletters, by forwarding them, when you watch my YouTube videos until the end or have attended one of my talks.



You can spent $Victory on pushing your pitch deck review higher on the list, get some **free** mentoring from me or redeem it with swag (NFT t-shirts!).



The $Victory coins are using a new smart contract from [OMGDrops](https://omgdrops.com/), so expect delays and bugs until everything is shortened out.



Tag me on social media with the message "I want to be Victorious" and I'll send you 100 $Victory coins!



5/ I have one last thing to say and it is not financial advice.



[Reddit is going public](https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838901/reddit-going-public-sec-s-1-filing-confidential).



That's all for this week, see you next week with (hopefully) some $Victory!
