<br>
  
##  1/ V as in Metaverse 2022 Videos are out!

Do you want to learn how **Spielberg** and **James Cameron** think and what makes them special?

We just released the videos of my "V as in MetaVerse 2022" conference, and now you learn about:

## 2/ A.I.

I don't think A.I. will take your job. I believe that you will take A.I.'s job! 🤖

Let me explain.

Obviously, A.I. has automated many things, and if you are not using A.I. tools to improve, you will lose your job pretty soon - that's a fact.

But the top people in every category are safe.

🤩 We still watch the _Olympics_ even though there are machines that do EVERYTHING better (there is no runner that is faster than a car). We still watch _NBA_, even though there are "machines" doing it better (see eSports). We still buy a unique piece of furniture while you can get something similar from IKEA.

We like watching humans struggle and compete because we can imagine ourselves in their shoes.

Look, for example, [this video right here](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx35pzApcorFndVnOQOyg-ynkmd6ueng2i).

You can replicate the scene with A.I., but it is not the same. It is not as impressive because it is not a testament to human ingenuity. To beat A.I., we must be more creative, playful, and real. You just have to be more human (especially when you are [locked in a Chinese Room](https://jon.io/should-i-sue-tim-ferris))

## 3/ Can Product-Market Fit be Measured? 🧐

In a world where **product-market fit (PMF)** can make or break your business, knowing where you stand is essential.

But how can you be sure you're on the right track? 🤷‍♀️

## 4/ Why are A.I. products different?

When it comes to A.I. product development, Silicon Valley's standard advice for startups doesn't apply.

Let me explain.  

[Open A.I. built their product the "wrong way"](https://fortune-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/fortune.com/2023/05/06/ceo-sam-altman-openai-ai-chatgpt-tech-startup-business-rules-broken/amp/) ignoring all the conventional startup rules, leading to great success.

**Anti-patterns**

1.  It took Open AI 4.5 years to launch a product.
2.  They are the most capital-intensive startup in Silicon Valley history.
3.  They built a technology without any idea of who their customers would be or what they would use it for.
4.  ChatGPT has no social features or built-in sharing
5.  You have to sign up before you can use it.

And yet, all of it resulted in an outstanding innovation and incredibly good software product.

## 5/ A proven strategy to go from 0 to 45k users in 12 months

📧 Before starting the development, launch a simple email newsletter and landing page to collect leads. Promise daily emails with content around tour products.  

🌱 Obtain organic leads by launching on Product Hunt, BetaList, and Reddit to generate interest.

💰 With the traction gained, secure a pre-seed funding round from investors.

📱 With the funding, launch your product and convert your audience to paying users.  

💻 Do performance marketing / paid marketing/growth hacking on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, etc., and bring in more users.

🔍 Start playing the SEO game, write content on various platforms and mostly on your website around your niche. Keep creating content on social media, create podcasts, and keep talking with your active users.

🚀 Double down on what works and eliminate what doesn't.

That's all for now. See you next week!
