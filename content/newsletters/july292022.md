👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **FutureTickets** 🎟️

> If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.

Last week I posted about my attempt to [build a radical new NFT Ticketing platform from scratch in 14 days.](https://jon.io/creating-the-most-epic-nft-ticketing-platform-in-14-days)

Of course, it is an extremely difficult task to build a whole web3 project on your own in just two weeks.

> **Unless you are me**. ✌️

This Sunday, **FutureTickets is going live** 🚀 with hopefully NOT so many errors, and I need your help!

I am looking for people to help with beta testing or even do a **meetup/event** using the platform (I promise it is INSANELY easy).

Help an Entrepreneur out, and to the first 10 that they will post a comment, I'll send **500 $Victory**!

<br>

2/ **My new Devlog is out and is fantastic!** You can't miss it!

**Devlog Day 3-6: Minting NFT for free and without a wallet**

As you already know, I am building an NFT platform where you can sell (and buy) NFT Tickets as part of [Polygon's Hackathon. ](https://buidlit.polygon.technology/)

This [Devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zinGATuVcZY) is day 3-4-5-6 of 14 days. 

You can now create NFTs for free without needing a wallet. And what's more amazing, people can claim their NFT Tickets without a wallet too! 🤯

<br>

3/ I've been asked to be in the **"Greek SharkTank"** 🦈, and I had one concern:

🤔 Do investors **make any money** in SharkTank or they invest just for the **branding**?
It seems they don't make any money as Mark Cuban is in the red.

Being on SharkTank as an investor is not free as you have to commit a minimum amount of money, so it comes down if paid advertising yields a better return.

What would you do? 📥

<br>

4/ **Is AI dangerous for humans?**

Apparently, it is!

A chess-playing robot broke the finger of a 7-year-old boy who was competing against it during a recent tournament in Moscow.

There is no violence in chess, they said. 

Check the story 🤯 [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2022/07/24/chess-playing-robot-breaks-finger-7-year-old-boy-during-match/)!

<br>

5/ **What's the best way to get your news?**

It's **TikTok**! (at least if you are a teen)

From Johnny Depp, to politics, to life advice, to investment advice, [IT IS TikTok](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62238307).

But even though you can get an insane amount of views on TikTok (way more than Instagram or YouTube), the conversion rates are extremely low. Like, disappointing low. 📉

That means that TikTok is a **"vanity" social media**: you get views, but you don't get "followers" thus, you don't get any money.

Are you using TikTok? I would love to know why and what's your opinion. 🤔

<br>

See you next week. 🚀
