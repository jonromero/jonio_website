**1/V.C. tears** 💦

If you have ever tried to raise money, I have the perfect product for you:

Let me introduce you to [V.C. Tears](https://jon.io/vctears).

V.C. Tears is my new hand-wash that helps you "clean" your pitch deck and give your super-pitching- powers. I hand-collected the tears from top V.C.s after they lost tons of money the last couple of years (thank you, web3 and stupid investments), and yes, it is epic.

Get it as a gift to your **V.C. friends** or your **fellow Entrepreneurs** or just use it for yourself and bathe in their pain.

🎟️ Use _EARLYTEARS_ for an ADDITIONAL **25% discount** and **free** **shipping** (only 50 coupons are available).  

Let me know what you think! 📥

**2/ VAIM: 2023** 🔜

I am excited to announce my 3rd conference, **"V as in MetaVerse: Until it's done."** with the main concept around A.I. and Startups.  

And not only is it taking place in Greece, but it will also spawn in the sacred Olympus mountain!

As with every **VAIM** **conference**, I try to do something different:

1.  The first one had tons of people flying from the U.S. to talk about _crypto_, _regulations_, and the _future of Blockchain_.
2.  The second one had the biggest _Hollywood Celebrities_, an _art exhibition_, and the most mind-blowing speakers.
3.  The third one needs to be **insane**. 🔥

🗓️ The dates are **_mid to end of June,_** and this time we'll have extremely limited space.  

Are you coming? 🙋

**3/ Open A.I. Robot**

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is working on a [humanoid robot](https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-working-humanoid-robot).

I just hope that it will follow [Assimov's Law of Robotics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics). 🤖

4/ Guess who is entering the **A.I.** race. Again.

You guess it right, _Elon Musk_.  

If you don't know, Elon was one of the [co-founders of Open A.I.](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai) but is no longer part of this company.

**_Last week, Elon hired 2 ex-DeepMind A.I. engineers and purchased 10,000 GPUs_** _(_ [_Source_](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/15/elon-musk-chatgpt-ai-rival-openai) _)_ **_._**

This means that, in the near term, we can see a ChatGPT developed within Twitter. And all of these happen just weeks after co-signing a letter demanding a pause in A.I. research. C'mon Elon. 🤦🏼‍♂️

🚩 _But be cautious – overemphasis on learning can lead to inaction._

**A lot of times, learning can be an excuse for not executing your idea.**  

There will always be something new to learn, a great book to read, and another seminar to attend. But this never-ending loop can keep you away from taking action. So, balance your learning and doing activities.

> The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge.
> \- Aristotle


👉 At the end of the day, it's not how much you know but how much you build with what you know.

That's all for now. See you next week!
