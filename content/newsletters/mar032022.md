**These are the highlights of the past week!**

<br>

1/ I am pretty sure you heard about** what is going on the last couple of weeks in Ukraine**, so I will just add an interesting DAO called [UkraineDAO](https://twitter.com/Ukraine_DAO). üá∫üá¶

A kickass art group (Pussy Riot) along with members from PleasrDAO - [that I talked about in a previous newsletter](https://jon.io/can-academics-build-products) created a DAO to raise money, and they already raised $3M. üí∞

If you donate funds, you'll get back **$LOVE** tokens.

It is interesting how fast the web3 community created mechanisms to help people in need.

You can read more about it [here](https://decrypt.co/93787/pussy-riot-trippy-labs-pleasrdao-launch-ukraine-dao).

<br>

2/ If you are an **Entrepreneur** and don't understand why **storytelling** is the most important skill you should possess, go and become an employee or work in the public sector. Or become a VC.

> Stories move people.

[In this week's video](https://youtu.be/W8pGyHP4PxU), I review a pitch deck that has a pretty good team, great business plan, traction but ... a weak pitch deck.

The good thing is that you can always improve your story with minimal effort. But I've seen a lot of companies (especially in Europe) that put "the story" on the back burner and end up either not raising money or getting crushed by inferior competitors. I literally know three Startups with epic products but no "story" that got acquired for way less than their competitors.

üí¨ Please, [leave a comment on the video](https://youtu.be/W8pGyHP4PxU). I would love to know what you think.

<br>

3/ **The times have changed, and being an employee doesn't work for anyone.** There is plenty of funding and opportunities to build and secure your financial future.

I stay in the game by trying to learn and play with whatever new pops up. Most of the time, this leads to nothing, but I get an unfair advantage a couple of times. 

Like when I started [algotrading with Ethereum](https://jon.io/trading-ethereum-making-10-every-20-minutes) six years ago when Ether was at $8. Or when [I jumped into NFTs](https://jon.io/i-bought-this-image-for-1500-and-i-sold-it-for-50-in-two-weeks) with my own platform and then with my [own conference](https://jon.io/i-organized-my-own-conference-like-gary-vee-in-30-days).

Yes, it doesn't always work, but you get a 100x return when it does. üìà

Have you ever found something before it becomes mainstream?

<br>

4/ I read a discussion on Linkedin about **unlimited PTO (Paid Time Off)** and [whether it is a scam.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/msjessicamatos_pto-takevacation-takeabreak-activity-6898063129184497664-YP6H/)

And I can say that yes, it is a scam if you are a pushover employee. Let me elaborate.

The issue with unlimited PTOs is that employees are psychologically forced not to use them. Or at least that's the idea. But the company **is not to blame.**

You and only you as an employee you have to set boundaries.

It is up to you. The company's purpose is not to cuddle you. The sooner you get this, the faster you can start growing.

Things that you can do:

1. Change your mentality from "oh, I have a lot of work I cannot get a vacation" to "I need time to recharge". **Communicate and escalate.** A good manager wants you to be in your top performance
2. If you think your manager doesn't care, again communicate and escalate. Don't make assumptions.
3. If you know that your manager won't do anything, well, time to look for a new job. Stop giving excuses to yourself and move. Start looking immediately.

What do you think about unlimited PTOs? üí≠

5/ **Do you know what a ".eth" address is?**

If you're following the web3 community on Twitter, you will see that more and more people change their handling, adding a ".eth" suffix.

![](https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/MRj0av3Bl3HgeZMguPLtschMFCCUXt259oFVOGfh16325)

[So, what is this address, where can you get yours, and what can you do with it?](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/everything-you-can-do-with-your-ens-name-right-now-9a66763e970a)

[ENS (Ethereum Name Space)](https://ens.domains/) is an Ethereum token that governs the Ethereum Name Service, a protocol for human-readable crypto addresses and decentralized domain names. 

[An ".eth" domain](https://twitter.com/ensdomains) is your web3 username. It gives you a decentralized naming for wallets, websites, & more!

1. **One Name For All of Your Addresses.** 
No more copying and pasting long addresses. Use your ENS name to store all of your addresses and receive any cryptocurrency, token, or NFT.

2. **Decentralised Websites**. Launch censorship-resistant decentralized websites with ENS. Upload your website to IPFS and access it with your ENS name.

3. **Tor .onion websites.** Add a Tor .onion address to your ENS records in the Content field; then, if you are using the Tor Browser with MetaMask enabled, just enter the .ETH name in the URL bar, and it should resolve to the .onion website.

4. **Text records** üìù Text records functionality allows you to voluntarily add various kinds of personal information to your ENS records.

5. You .eth address is an **NFT**.

6. Make your NFT your ENS **Profile Avatar**

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week!
