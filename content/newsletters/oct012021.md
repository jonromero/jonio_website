It is Friday (already!) and it is time for another email from your favorite Entrepreneur (that is me - I hope!).



1/ Last week I started reviewing Pitch decks that Startups are sending to me. I am already on the 3rd video and I think it is gets better and better. I would love it if you check it out and give me some feedback (and if you like & subscribe I'll give you a virtual high five!).



[Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X__PJmLnUAk) (and find the hidden gems in the video ;)

2/ Last year, [I helped a whole country to fight COVID-19](https://jon.io/how-i-spent-my-summer-helping-to-save-a-whole-country). It was crazy how much difference a single person can make. The biggest misconception is that we cannot make a change. I am here to tell you, that you - yes, YOU - can create and shape the world if you put your mind into it.



EVA (the Machine Learning Platform that analyzed thousands of tourists), just made it into Nature. Yes, the biggest scientific magazine in the world. Which is crazy! Hopefully this work will inspire more people to build cool stuff.



3/ I started training how I breathe - because how [we are breathing is wrong](https://jon.io/you-are-breathing-wrong). I plan to post some more articles about biohacking and how you can improve your performance and reduce your stress.



4/ [Snoop Dogg bought this image for $3.9M](https://decrypt.co/82069/snoop-dogg-buys-xcopy-ethereum-nft-for-3-9-million). Yes, the NFT space is still going strong. What, still not convinced? Twitter seems to be also adding NFTs to their platform.

5/ Amazon released a [$999 robot](https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-523/) that "runs" around your house. And a [$250 drone](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs) that flies inside your house. And Facebook released a [pair of glasses](https://www.sfgate.com/culture-columns/article/Facebook-Ray-Ban-sunglasses-Drew-Magary-16497129.php). If you are wondering why, the answer is simple: Data collection.



Thatâ€™s it for today. See you next week.



Jon V (as in Victory)
