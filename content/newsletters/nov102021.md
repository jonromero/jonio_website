Let's talk about the Top 5 things that happened last week.



1/ Last time I talked about [Metaverse Cities](https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities). What I haven't told you is that I am a Citizen of the [CityDAO](https://www.citydao.io/). CityDAO has bought real land in Wyoming and a community of 6k+ citizens is planning to build a whole city. Seems that the Metaverse is clashing with reality pretty hard.



The reason I am excited about DAOs is that I am working on launching a new DAO about the Metaverse and Web3. If you want to be involved - drop by [my Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA) and join the channel #TheDao.



2/ In my latest [pitch deck review](https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/e84rop), I talk about what most investors look in a pitch deck. Hint: It is money.

3/ I've invested in a lot of DAOs and "not traditional" companies but one of them will blow your mind with their business model.



There is a crypto game called [Axie Infinity](https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/84204r), valued at $3 Billion and got funding from the biggest VCs on the planet. To participate in that game you need to buy their NFTs and then by playing you can earn money - this is called Play-to-Earn (P2E).



What is mind blowing is that you can invest in a "company" that buys the NFTs and "rents" them out to players in countries like the Philippines. These players play all day long, win money and they "profit-share" with you.



In case you still haven't got it, you can have your own e-Sports team, running fully decentralized and autonomously, earning money while you sleep.

4/ Netflix is [expanding to games](https://sendfox.com/trk/click/4g26oke7/p8ovgd). You will be able to buy and play games using your Netflix subscription. It seems that all companies at the moment became game companies and then add NFTs. I wonder if anyone is still building non-Entertainment products.



Thatâ€™s it for today. See you next week.


PS: I am reviving the "Algorithms Pay My Bills" Community on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ePSSJdzfqA), so if you want to drop by and chit-chat, you are more than welcome!
