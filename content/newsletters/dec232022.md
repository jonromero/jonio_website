👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Do you know what is **INSANE**? 

🌐 I organized the biggest **Web3** conference in Europe, and it was beyond epic!

Last week, my ["V as in MetaVerse"](https://jon.io/metaverse2022) took place in Athens, and it blew my mind. 

The energy was insane. The speakers were unique. The people that I met were awesome. The activities and the parties - OMG! Insanity! 🙌

My **"V Conf"** is special - on purpose. I specifically try to avoid things that I hate in "normal" conferences.

Everyone **will** talk to everyone. They will do business together. You get to actually meet the speakers - speakers that you've NEVER had the chance to see before in ANY other conferences.

All of these were in an epic space: [An epic gallery](https://theblendergallery.com/) where we were surrounded by limited edition art and artifacts from Hollywood movies that we flew from Los Angeles.

And after all these: Parties. Crazy parties with awesome food. 🥂

This conference was waaaaaay bigger than my last one. More days, more people, speakers, sponsors, and energy. I couldn't have done it without the help of some amazing people (Athina and Anni, you rule!).

🔜 What's next? I have to release the videos and an ebook about the conference (made by Stable Diffusion) and prepare for the next one.

📩 If you attended the event, I would love it if you make some comments below!

2/ My **community** (which includes **you**, reading this right now) has more than **6,000 people.** 🌐

Every year I remove anyone that hasn't read my emails for at least three months. I have no issue going from **10k to 4k** as long as these people are the ones that they really care about my content.

This took introspection as the **"vanity metric"** of having a lot of subscribers feeds my ego but doesn't feed my creativity.

Every once in a while, I send questionnaires to find what **you** want out of this "relationship", but my friend Athiná had another idea.

Her company, [Owiwi](https://owiwi.co.uk/), is specialized in finding the perfect employee through a gamified experience. So I asked her if we could use the tool to find the Entrepreneurial status of someone (including resilience and epicness). Maybe if we repeat this after a year, we can see how much I "helped you" grow as an Entrepreneur. No idea!

So, if you want to see how entrepreneurial you are, resilient and awesome, use [this link](https://dashboard.owiwi.co.uk/play-campaign?key=Lyty). It is free, and I'll publish all the results.

📩 Feel free to send me an email with feedback, and I'll forward it to Athiná, and I'll send you **499 ✌️ $Victory coins**!

3/ Speaking of **"vanity metrics"**, let me tell you about the [Metrics Onion.](https://sketchplanations.com/the-metrics-onion)

📊 **Vanity metrics** are statistics that look spectacular on the surface but don’t necessarily translate to any meaningful business results. Examples of vanity metrics include social media followers, website traffic, and email subscribers. These metrics may look impressive on the surface, but they do not necessarily reflect a business's true value or performance.

📈 On the other hand, **"Τhe Μetrics Οnion"** helps us to identify "metrics that matter", meaning they are closely tied to a business's core objectives and goals. They provide a deeper understanding of the health and performance of a business and can be used to make informed decisions about how to improve and grow. Examples of onion metrics include customer retention rate, lifetime value, and churn rate. These metrics are typically more meaningful and relevant than vanity metrics in terms of gauging the success and impact of a business or product.

4/ The creators of **South Park** just got **$20M** 💰 to [build a Deep Fake VFX Studio](https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/trey-parker-matt-stone-deep-voodoo-deepfake-funding-1235466563/). But there is more to the story.

They planned to release a full movie with Deep Fake (including Donald Trump, Zuckerberg, and many other celebrities), but it was canceled due to COVID. There is a trailer online, and you should DEFINITELY check it out. It is a masterpiece.

The deep fake for that movie is really impressive, and after some thinking, they decided to turn it into a company.

Would you watch a movie with **Deep Fake actors**?

5/ As **2022** comes to an end, let's play a game.

Grab a **pen and paper** 📝 (yes, put your laptop aside and use a pen and a piece of paper) and write down **10 highlights** of the past year. 

What are you most proud of? What did you do well? What were the best moments of 2022?

Don't overthink it. The things that will come first in your mind are probably the most important ones!

**Reflect** on the past year and allow yourself a moment of gratitude for all you have accomplished. 🙏

😉 Next time, we'll continue this exercise, so stay tuned!

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
