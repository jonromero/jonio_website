These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **Why Reddit's NFT marketplace is huge news?** üì¢ 

Reddit is also launching a crypto wallet. And some kind of currency. All in one go.

The narrative that NFTs are on a decline is kind of stupid. Yes, maybe super famous people don't flash their BYAC on TV anymore, but I keep seeing products integrating NFTs every single day.

2/ **Birth** üë∂, **School** üéí, **Metallica**ü§ò, **Death** ‚ö∞Ô∏è


Yes, I ‚ù§Ô∏è Metallica. And I think they are brilliant Entrepreneurs. Here are some tricks we can learn from them:

* To make their music known, they played IN EVERY SINGLE place they were invited to. Even birthday parties (ok, maybe not birthday parties). That made their "product" better and exposed more people to their brand. 

> Talk about your product. Put it in front of people and make it awesome.

* They started from a niche and expanded commercially. Find your product-market fit and THEN expand. Most musicians cannot make the jump and end up with a couple of hits.

* They bought back their songs, and they have their own record label. Always try to control your branding and your messaging. Protect it at all costs.

* They love their fans. I've been to countless Metallica unplugged concerts for charity, and I've even seen them performing in a drive-in during COVID-19. They clearly love what they do, and they love their fans. **IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY.**

* They keep experimenting - because building stuff is supposed to be fun. If you don't love what you are doing, you can never be the best.

üì∫ Now, go and see the last season of [Stranger Things and listen to Master of Puppets](https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/metallicas-master-puppets-earns-400-increase-streams-post-86403695)!

3/ **_Snap_** is hiring the Director of the US Secret Service.

That's it. [I don't have anything else to say.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/7/23199144/snap-hires-head-of-us-secret-service)

Probably nothing. ü§î

<br>

4/ As you already probably know, **the crypto market has been bleeding for the last several months.**

For me, the most significant **upside of market downtrends** is that there is less noise, more humility, and more feedback in the space.

Let's see where all this will go.

<br>


5/ Many readers of this newsletter are thinking of starting their own Startup.

The **"startup game"** looks compelling and lucrative with potentially high rewards. But before you decide to enter this game, you must know that almost 75% of startups fail in the first 5 years.

Here is a comprehensive list explaining why Startups fail.

See you next week. üöÄ
