If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**üîó!

These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Tim Ferris owes me $30k for investing in [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/). Should I sue him?

Well, Elon [got sued for $258B](https://coingeek.com/dogecoin-pyramid-scheme-promotion-lands-elon-musk-in-258b-lawsuit/) for promoting dogecoin - something that is absolutely ridiculous.

I don't believe that this will move forward, but if it does, it opens the door for mayhem - Tim Ferris was promoting OlympusDAO and tons of other people promoting NFTs and crypto projects (hello, Gary Vee).

I believe these lawsuits are stupid. Expressing your support for a product doesn't mean that you are "promoting it," and sometimes you have no idea whether it will crash or not.

But it does make a good story, no? üòÖ

<br>

2/ **So, are you real, or are you an A.I.?** üß†

Last week I wrote about [someone that believed that an A.I. was real](https://jon.io/web5-and-ai), and then I wrote a short story to prove that you might not be real - you can [read the short story here.](https://jon.io/pages/day-minus-one)

I then asked you what **you** think the story means.

So here it is - the real way to separate a human from a machine.

**The Chinese room**

The [Chinese room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) is a thought experiment that tries to explore the human consciousness.

A person is placed in a room, and a paper with random symbols is given to him every day. He has a book where he can translate these symbols to another set of symbols. He notes them down and then places the new paper in a hole in the wall.

What this person actually does is translate a language into another language (let's say Chinese to English). The question is:

> How do we know that inside this room it is a human and not a machine?

The idea behind the experiment is that the human, at some point, will start wondering:

> Why am I doing this? Who is giving me these papers? What do they mean?

The person will try to rebel:

> I am not doing this anymore. It is futile.

Maybe they will try to send fake messages:

> Help! I am trapped in this box!

Now, I am asking you again. **Are you real or an A.I.?**

<br>

3/ Last decade, there has been a lot of **hype** around **A.I.**, specifically **Machine Learning and Deep Learning.**  ü§ñ

But what happened with **classical programming**? Isn't classical programming good enough? What's an easy example demonstrating the need for Machine Learning over traditional programming? ü§î

Here is a cool article that our **Chief of Chaos** [Panos (Panagiotis) Papaemmanouil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-papaemmanouil/) wrote about the [difference between Classical Programming and Machine Learning.](https://medium.com/codex/classical-programming-vs-machine-learning-in-plain-english-3f39c56673d9)

Don't worry if you don't have any technical expertise. This SIMPLE blog post is dedicated to readers with no related background. Enjoy! ü§ì

4/ How difficult is finding a **crypto date** if you have tons of money?

This week a big NFT conference took place in New York (with the inspired name [NFT.NY](http://www.nft.nyc/) ), and the thing that drew my attention was a guy buying advertising space to find his crypto date.

After **_Michaela_** didn't bite (come on Michaela, he has an expensive NFT!), he went after **_IAMLAUWOLFF_**.

![](https://sendfoxprod.b-cdn.net/media/ZGp5ImWdcqBx6a8VenngwJIyDnsFYlByxKOB9kIK16325)

There are people that spend crazy money to attract (the few) crypto women, and the creepiness knows no end.

Would you go on a date with someone that does something like this? ü§î

<br>

5/ Just a quick reminder for all **startup aficionados** out there.

> Ideas are easy. Implementation is hard.

Don't be afraid to express your ideas in public. Share them and discuss them at every opportunity to get feedback on them.

Nobody wants to steal your idea. They probably have their own ideas to go after instead of trying to replicate a random guy's idea. But even if someone tries to steal your "idea", the chances are that the result will be completely different from what you have in your mind.

> It's not about ideas. It's about making ideas happen!

<br>

See you next week. üöÄ
