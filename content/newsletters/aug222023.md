👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ Marry me

I am in beautiful [Crete in Greece](https://www.visitgreece.gr/islands/crete/) 🇬🇷 for a wedding that is going to happen in a couple of hours (congrats Kyriakos and Mania!), and this is my view:

But let me tell you about a guy that proposed to his girlfriend AND entered the Guinness Record by drawing with his plane **_"Will you marry me"_** using GPS.

First of all, it wasn't easy. It took 3 months. And he had to leave his job.

But at least she said yes 😀

## 2/ Kafka

**_"Everything you love will probably be lost."_**

This is the (unconfirmed) story of [Franz Kafka](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) and a girl that lost her doll and a sweet twist.

Kafka was in his 40s and was strolling around the park. All of a sudden, he saw a little girl crying. He asked her why, and she said she lost her favorite doll. They looked around together, but they couldn't find the doll. 🙁

The next day, Kafka went to the park, found the girl, and gave her a note. The note was from her doll.  

> 📝 Don't cry! I took a trip to see the world! I will write you all about my adventures!

Before Kafka died, he met the girl and gave her a note from her doll, describing her adventures around the globe in great detail. The girl was happy!

After some time, Kafka bought a new doll (the doll returned!). The girl immediately said, "This doesn't look my doll," and Kafka handed her another note:

> 📝 The travels have changed me.

A year later, Kafka died.

The girl grew up, and after a very long time, she found a final note inside the doll, the last letter from Kafka:

> 📝 Everything you love will probably be lost but in the end, love will return in another way.

## 3/ Character Alarm

I [wrote a couple of times](https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan) about how to use **Alter Ego** to improve yourself, but this is a new trick I plan to start using soon.
  
It's called [The Character Alarm](https://twitter.com/RomeenSheth/status/1687078247194918912?t=MBvsqC99YtushDKRhxKdbQ&s=19).

The idea is simple:

You put **5 alarms** during the day, and each alarm "wakes" up a character. You need to act like that character for that period.  

Example of three alarms from [Eric Partaker](https://twitter.com/Eric_Partaker/status/1613884327481479178?t=Za-hrqRbi2pI1944NEIxeQ&s=19) below:

## 4/ KPIs 101

A few months ago, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) was the fastest-growing app ever, surpassing **1 million** users in just 5 days.

And then [Threads](https://www.threads.net/) came out and hit the same milestone in just **one hour**! 🤯 For context, Threads had **100 million users** in its first 5 days of launch (100X more than ChatGPT).

It sounds incredible, but unfortunately, these metrics don't tell the full story. 😟

As a startup founder, you want to track important KPIs and not fall into the trap of _vanity metrics._

> Vanity metrics are metrics that make you look good to others but don't help you understand your own performance in a way that informs future strategies.  

For example, Threads' **active users** are down from an all-time high of about 75%. Ouch! 🤕

📊 Here's a list of 10 KPIs you must start tracking to help you better understand how your business is performing.

**1/ Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**
How much money are you making each month?

**2/ Annualized Run Rate (ARR)**
What's your annual revenue estimate?
  
**3/ Gross Margin**
Is your business making more money than it's spending?

**4/ Monthly Active Users (MAU)**
How many people are using your product each month?  

**5/ Customer churn**
Are you losing more customers than you gain?

**6/ Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**
What's the long-term value of a customer?

**7/ Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
How much does it cost to get a new customer?

**8/ Product Usage Metrics**
Depending on your product, track specific usage metrics such as feature adoption rates, task completion times, or content engagement (for content-based startups).

**9/ Customer Feedback &** **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
Are your customers happy enough to recommend you?

**10/ Runway**
The runway measures the time that a startup has before they run out of finances.

💡 Success isn't just about huge numbers; it's about understanding these KPIs and how they connect. It's like building a puzzle - you need all the right pieces in place.

What KPIs do you find most valuable in your startup journey? 🤔

## 5/ Tools to Grow 🚀

🤫 This is your chance to steal my secrets.

For the last topic, I will give you a glimpse of the 🛠️ **tools** and 🔁 **processes** I use to grow my brand as an _Angel Investor & Entrepreneur._

Read it, get inspired, and start building your brand today.

It's actually super simple.

I maintain **4 mediums** where people can read about my adventures and reach out.

1.  **My LinkedIn profile -** [https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnvlachoyiannis/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnvlachoyiannis/)
2.  **My Website -** [https://jon.io/](https://jon.io/)
3.  **My Weekly Newsletter** - [https://jon.io/category/newsletters](https://jon.io/category/newsletters)
4.  **My YouTube Channel** - [https://www.youtube.com/@jonvictory](https://www.youtube.com/@jonvictory)

📬 Every Friday, I send an EPIC newsletter with 5 awesome things I learned during the week around topics like Startups, Entrepreneurship, Crypto, Metaverse, NFTs, Technology, and many more.

_So make sure you are following me everywhere._

To run these mediums, I use **3 tools.**


**1/ Buffer** - [https://buffer.com/](https://buffer.com/)
Buffer is a platform that helps you organize and schedule the content for your social media profiles.

**2/ GitHub Pages + Code** - [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)
Since I'm a software engineer, I created my website from scratch using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and used GitHub pages to host it for free. But don't worry if you are not a coder. There are plenty of options out there to create your website in no time, but you might have to pay a small amount to use them.

**3/ SendFox** - [https://sendfox.com/](https://sendfox.com/)
SendFox is a simple email marketing solution that lets you set up email automations, send campaigns, and create landing pages. I use it to send my weekly email.

And that's it. 🎉

For exactly **$0 per month**, you can start building your own personal brand online, and I guarantee that it will open more doors than you could ever imagine.

Start building! 🚧

That's all for now. See you next week!
