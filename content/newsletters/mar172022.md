If it is your first time here or you want to binge-read past letters, here are all of them.📰

**These are the highlights of the past week!**

<br>

1/ [Instagram will add NFTs](https://fortune.com/2022/03/15/mark-zuckerberg-instagram-nft-marketplace-mint/), and it is not something that I didn't know as Meta is hiring Web3 engineers like crazy.
This means that a MetaCoin is not far, and a MetaWallet is coming soon. 🚀

<br>

2/ I've been doing [Startup pitch deck reviews](https://jon.io/youtube) for some time now, and I keep getting more and more pitch decks to the point that even if I post one every day, it will take me a couple of years to go through all of them.

I need to find a way to make this **scalable** and **more impactful** as there are a lot of good ideas here.

That means that I am experimenting with some changes.

I'll open my **advisory slots** to everyone (currently, I keep 10 slots per month for bigger companies). To book a slot, you need to have ✌️ [$Victory coins](https://victory.jon.io/), or if you are a bigger company/organization, grab a paid slot - if available. If you are interested in this, please send me an email, and I'll send you an email with more info.

1. Launch my first version of my **Startup Course** 📚 that covers how to make a great pitch deck
2. Do a **"Live Pitch Deck Review"** once per month on Youtube with as many pitch decks as I can cover. It will be fun 😀

📩 Let me know what do you think!

3/ One of the personas I want to create - I talked about alter egos [last time](https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan) - is someone that has no idea about crypto. And then, I'll start attending crypto events.

Like [this guy here and his hilarious story.](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/15/cryptocurrency-coinbase-fintech-bros)

Most of the Startup events have turned into crypto events, and that's not bad (ok, it is bad and annoying), but at least I get to see how people approach new technologies.

Have you ever attended a crypto event? What's your take?

<br>

4/ There was an NFT project - a game, to be more specific - called Pixelmon. It released some footage of their amazing artwork, and yes - $70M 💰 was raised.

The days passed, and the community wanted to see the game and experience the artwork. And then the memes came.

Read about the [story and definitely check the images and the videos.](https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/people-spent-9k-on-pixelmon-nfts-then-they-saw-the-art/)

Absolutely hilarious. 😂

<br>

5/ Last week, I talked about how IHOP 🥞 was [trying to copy my $Victory coins with their PanCoins.](https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan)

This week, the heavy metal band 🤘 [Megadeth has released $MegaCoins.](https://megadeth.com/news/2022/megacoin-gibson-giveaway/) You can get some of them if you are part of their community, and you can spend them on swag/tickets, etc.

Exactly as my✌️ [$Victory coins](https://victory.jon.io/)!

Having said that, [here is a link for 20 $Victory coins](https://victory.jon.io/claim/megajon) for the first 50 of you that are fast enough to claim them!

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week!

-- Jon V (as in Victory) 🚀
