👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ VAIM2023

Do you want to bring foreign investors to Greece?

Super easy.

Do an epic conference (hint: on a **SuperYacht** 🛥️).

Last year, the biggest Tech conference on the planet happened in Greece (that's "V as in MetaVerse" in case you are under a digital rock)!

We had Oscar winners, NBA teams (sort of), and TWO investors that put money into Greek Startups (ok, one of them was me).

But the other investor is a HUUUUUGE Hollywood name, and the Startup came to Los Angeles and got introduced to people that 99.999999% of us will never even be in the same room (by _us,_ I mean _you_. _You_ won't be in the same room. I am just awesome).

Why am I telling you this?

📅 This summer, **4th and 5th of July**, my **3rd VAIM** conference is taking place and will be waaaay crazier. Trust me on this. We are talking **100x crazier.** 🤯

Startup pitches, taking place on a SuperYacht, and the biggest names in tech as speakers. Oh, and a run 🏃 on mountain Olympus (25th of June!).  

**Tickets** 🎫 and **website** 🌐 are coming soon but sharing with your network will get you closer to an invite!

Lets goooooo. 🚀

## 2/ Financial advice

I am building a new app for financial epicness, and I am wondering if I should include a fortune teller. 🔮

Let me explain.  

Anything that has to do with "_financials_" is boring.

Don't agree? [Well, 1 in 4 millennials prefer to ask a fortune teller than a financial advisor](https://fortune.com/2023/04/19/empower-avoiding-money-talks-young-people-consulting-fortune-tellers-financial-advice-over-experts-elon-musk-net-worth).

The financial sector needs a disruptor 💥 like "**Tik Tok**".
 
How do you manage/optimize your financials? 🤔

## 3/ Gamers

I've posted about [pigeons reading X-rays](https://jon.io/the-company-that-made-30m-in-a-month-and-pigeonic-doctors) in the past, but who knew that gamers could be [better doctors](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/video-gamers-make-good-surgeons/)?

Ok, that's not 100% true, as the story is that surgeons that played more games were better at their job. So by extension, if I ever become a doctor, I'll be the best.

Kidding aside, there is a lot of research that confirms that games teach strategy and coordination and decrease stress.

🕹️ Do you play any games?

## 4/ Building in the era of AI

If you want to ride the AI wave and build unique applications that feel like magic ✨, you must have the right tools in your toolkit.

Are you wondering how to make a "ChatGPT" for your documents or want to build a next-generation chatbot? Then you should check [LangChain](https://langchain.com/).

**LangChain is THE framework for developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).**  

With minimal Python knowledge and a few hours of your time, you can build [applications that were impossible](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) to make before 6 months! 

Can you imagine that? A whole new space of unexplored possibilities.

## 5/ Failure to Success

**_"There's no failure in sports. It's steps to success."_** 🔥

I'm sure you've already seen this [short clip from Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mXGSjnUvSM), which went viral last week.  

> "There are good days, bad days. Some days you are able to be successful, some days you're not. Some days it's your turn; some days it's not yours."

Nike also made a [whole new marketing campaign](https://twitter.com/Nike/status/1652060028507938825) just by quoting these words. 🗞️  

The same applies to **_Startups_** and **_Life_** in general. If something doesn't work for you, learn the lesson and move on. 99% of the founders I know didn't become successful in their first venture. They tried and failed multiple times, more times than you've ever thought of trying.

So, stop complaining and start creating.

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week!
