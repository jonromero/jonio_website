Title: I run a Marathon and it was Epic

First of all, in case you don't know, I hate long distance running. It is stupid, boring and not fun at all.

And these are the exact reasons why I wanted to do a Marathon. Here are some stats/trivia from my training and how YOU can run a Marathon (yes, you 100% can run a Marathon).


1/ I run 350 miles/560 km during my 5 months of training. I should have run 500 miles but it seems I was ok with just 70% of my training

You can find the training program you SHOULD follow from [Venice Run Club](https://venicerunclub.co/) here [and on the next tab you can see](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HAZDgqCDcOZZtNjMF35emNygsEgLFvbb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117468621612200276461&rtpof=true&sd=true) what I actually did.


2/ The longest run I did was 20 miles/32 km (I did it two times)
3/ I run (for fun!) a half marathon a month before the my official Marathon and it was a walk in the park (less than 2 hours!). It is still unbelievable to me that I could do that
4/ I had a CRAZY injury/accident that almost destroyed everything (more about that on my video)
5/ I did my long runs on Friday - because I am FIRE and I can do whatever I want
6/ My only Sunday run was with [Bryan Johnson](https://www.bryanjohnson.com/) 

7/ I was Strength Training 1 hour with 2 personal trainers every single week - this was an overkill

8/ The actual Marathon was "ok" until mile 20 / 32 km. Then it was a grind

9/ It took me 2 days to fully recover (hooray for biohacking!)

10/ My Cholesterol was slashed in half, along with my LDL. Yes, IN HALF. I don't know if it is because I started Nutty Pudding or not.

11/ Don't buy expensive stuff. Spend all your money on the best shoes (which are the Nike Vaporfly) and that's all you need.

10/ To put more stress on me, I had arranged a "Winner's party" right after the Marathon. With Pizzas. So I had to finish the Marathon :)

I'll definitely keep running (not THAT much) and I would love to do the Athens Marathon and a couple more Half Marathons but my main issue is the muscle loss.



Not only I didn't lose any weight (that's on me and the pizzas I was eating - but again, HALF Cholesterol baby!) but I am pretty sure I lost a good amount of muscle. Next week I'll go for a DEXA scan and see what's the damage.


## Time to become a Body Builder

"Running a marathon" was one of the many things I wanted to do for my "never-ending" project Until It Is Done.

And next (along with [HeyFire](https://heyfire.co)) is competing to a Body Building competition! How crazy is that?

I'll share more stuff during the next couple of weeks as there are TONS of stuff that need to be done - so stay tuned!


## Wall Street Journal 

My biohacking adventures made it to the Wall Street Journal!

A couple of months ago, I decided to expand my biohacking research to reversing gray hair. I posted on YouTube my experiments, went viral and then I started talking with WSJ.
