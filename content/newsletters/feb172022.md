**These are the highlights of the past week!**

<br>

1/ This is how Coinbase made (probably) a 20x return from their ad in **Super Bowl.**

> Would you spend $6M for a 30-second ad? ü§î

Well, it might sound stupid, but these are the prices you pay to advertise during the biggest athletic event in the U.S. - the Super Bowl. This year, most ads were about electric vehicles and (of course) crypto, with Coinbase stealing the show. If you haven't watched Coinbase's ad, you can see it below (yes, that is the ad).

**But did Coinbase ad make any money?**

The Lifetime Value of a customer for Coinbase is **$250 (on average)**. To break even, Coinbase will need **24k new users.** But they also gave away **$15** to each user so let's say **26k new users** to break even.

On average, an ad has a 1% to 3% conversion rate (and usually ads, where you give away money, have a higher conversion rate). Let's go with a 0.5% conversation rate to be very conservative.

The total eyeballs that watched Super Ball were 117M. That means 117M * 0.5% = **585k new converted users** which translates a **~20x return of investment (ROI)**. Yes, 20x.

> Coinbase spent $6M and probably "made" ~ $120M

That doesn't sound stupid, right? üí∞

P.S.: The calculations are ballpark (Super Bowl park!)

2/ During my last couple of emails, I told you about **$Victory coins** - my social currency - and I've promised you to send you some.

And oh, I have news! This week I'll post on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jonromero) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/) the official link that you can go and **claim your free $Victory coins plus places you can spend them!** And if you've sent me an email in the past to claim your $Victory, you'll get another link too! And there is more.

I have documented the whole process in a mini-YouTube series where I go over

1. how to create your own currency,
2. how to create your own web3 app
3. how to design it and market it

All. Of. It. Just [subscribe on my channel](https://jon.io/youtube), so you don't miss this.

3/ Most of you are sending me emails about exciting things you found. And I want to include you in the process (and give you some sweet $Victory!).

If you want to write a small paragraph about something that you found interesting in Startups, Products, web3, or Crypto and **get 10 $Victory**, go to [this form](https://forms.gle/oNmbWDjPeu5TjezY8) and submit a story!

If I choose to include your paragraph in the newsletter, I'll send you 10 $Victory, mention you on my newsletter, Linkedin (and sometimes Twitter and Instagram).

Let's see how that goes!

<br>

4/ Let me introduce you to your new obsession: the [**Dead Internet Theory**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/08/dead-internet-theory-wrong-but-feels-true/619937/). 

This theory (or should I say conspiracy theory?) talks about how the internet is fake, and most interactions come from an A.I. that has been taken over. Follow up the rabbit hole; it is quite interesting - unless you don't really exist, and I am posting just for the amusement of bots (unless I am also a bot ü§ñ!)

<br>

5/ If you've never been to Disneyland, I can assure you it is a pretty fun place (I prefer the one in France btw). But some people really really really want their everyday Disney dose.

That's why Disney decided to create a [Storyline community](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/16/22937210/disney-residential-communities-storyliving-cotino-planned-town) where you can buy (or rent) a house and live next to Goofy, Micky, and Mini!

Now it's your move Netflix.

<br>

See you next week.
