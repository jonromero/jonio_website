👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

1/ **I got slammed by Mark Cuban on Twitter.** 😬

In a previous newsletter, I posted [that Marc never made money from Shark Tank.](https://jon.io/i-am-afraid-to-go-to-the-sharktank-as-an-investor)

Which is technically right but not 100% correct.

And [he explained to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1567005142616260608?s=20&t=FqSwfdOL-p8NdZsuoMTQDg) that he hasn't made any cash, but he is "up" in terms of equity.

Which is correct! Not realized gains **ARE** gains (even though Startup investments are not liquid).

Sorry, Mark. I'll take the L in this one. 🫢

2/ **I added my face on my site, and conversions went up 10%.**

Here is the story.

I was reading [Dean's latest newsletter](https://www.deanyeong.com/newsletter), and at the bottom, he had a link:

> Like what you just read? Leave me a review and feedback.

Clicking redirects you to a page where you can leave your video/audio comment using [VideoAsk.](https://www.videoask.com/)

I liked the concept, and I started looking for other widgets that might be interesting. I found a _**"chat head"**_ feature that looked fun, and OH, I cannot tell you how many takes I had to take to have something REMOTELY interesting.

And yes, I definitely have to re-record this video when it is not a thousand degrees here in Los Angeles.

Check it out on [my website](https://jon.io/), and let me know what you think!

3/ Here are five (easy) strategies to **grow your Twitter account.** 🗒️

1. Don't focus on writing the "perfect" viral tweet. Just keep writing daily.
2. Commenting on other accounts is how people find out about you. DO NOT SELL and try to be relevant.
3. Your Twitter account should have one "vibe". Is it funny? Is it professional? Is it sarcastic? Stick to that persona.
4. Find the "why" of your Twitter. Why do you need more followers? Vanity? Are you selling something? Maybe just for fun?
5. Do not use the same content across all social media. The audiences are different.

What do you think? Anything to add? 🤔

4/ By now, everyone knows that **NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token.**

But what **exactly** does this mean?

You can think of it like this;

> If you borrowed one, would it be odd if you returned a different one?

Here is an awesome sketch describing the difference between Fungible and Non-Findglibe items (source)

* **Fungible** goods as mutually interchangeable in that, in principle, you could swap any unit for any other unit of the same type or kind, and it would be equivalent (e.g., money, fuel, commodities)
* **Non-fungible** goods are unique and not mutually interchangeable (houses, art, people, used cars).

5/ **Have you ever felt like you're speeding to keep up with everything in your life?**

A lot of people tell me that they feel they don't have enough time. They constantly juggle between projects, and in the end, they are exhausted but without significant progress on anything.

So, here is my advice to everyone who experiences something like this.

> You need to **focus on one thing!** Find what passionates you and put all your energy, time, and brain power into this! Forget about everything else and focus on this.

It's easy in theory, but in practice, many of us fail to do it. So, here is one more practical piece of advice.

> If it's not a hell yes, it's a no!

Keep that in mind the next time a new idea comes your way to separate opportunities from distractions.

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
