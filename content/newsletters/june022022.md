If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**🔗!

These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ I don't know if you know, but I wrote a book 📘 **about my hands** 👐 and I am giving it away for free!

Yes, there is a whole story behind it.

Some time ago, I wanted to write a book. And to learn how to self-publish and promote a book, I "wrote" a book called _**"What I do with my hands"**_ - [read the full story here](https://jon.io/why-i-wrote-a-book-about-my-hands).

I loved the experience, but I mostly loved how everyone loved the book.

So, for a whole week, you can [download it for free from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/What-I-do-my-hands-ebook/dp/B0832CT9FT), but please write your **honest opinion as a review**.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Enjoy!

2/ Almost a year ago, the head of Product of OpenSea was fired as the community figured out that he was buying NFTs **right before putting them on the main page**.

The interesting thing is that he was [charged In the First-Ever Digital Asset Insider Trading Scheme](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-nft-marketplace-charged-first-ever-digital-asset-insider-trading-scheme).

That means two things:
1. NFTs are starting to have tighter regulations around them
2. There are real-world (not only in the metaverse) consequences

🤔 I wonder if this will create a precedent for all these scams that take place.

3/ **Remote work** has grown into a **controversial** topic, specifically in the tech industry. As we gradually get back to normal after Covid19 restrictions, some companies decide to go permanently to remote work, while others try to enforce a return to office policies.

Some [newsletter](https://jon.io/the-wealth-transfer-has-started-but-it-is-not-what-you-think) ago, I wrote how [Apple lost its Director of Machine Learning because they wanted everyone back in the office](https://www.engadget.com/an-apple-machine-learning-director-resigned-over-its-office-return-policy-115040691.html).

This time, Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla executives, **demanding** employees return to the office. Actually, he wrote that _"Anyone who wishes to do remote work must be in the office for a minimum (and I mean *minimum*) of 40 hours per week or depart Tesla."_

In a [follow-up email](https://twitter.com/SamNissim/status/1531810291222192130), trying to defend his decision, he wrote:

> The more senior you are, the more visible your presence must be. That is why I lived in the factory so much - so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt.

What **do you think** about this? Is remote work a productivity or innovation killer?

4/ Here is a really cool infographic explaining how Startups Funding works and the concept of Stock Dilution.

To give you a brief idea, most of the time, the stages of a Startup 🚀 are going as follows:

1. Idea stage [You]
2. Co-founder stage [You + Co-founder(s)]
3. Pre-seed [Family and Friends, Angel Investors]
4. Seed Round [Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists]
5. Series A, B, C, ... [Venture Capitalists, Investment Bankers]
6. IPO (Initial Public Offering) [Anyone]

_**Dilution**_ happens when a company issues additional stock, which comes with growth. When successful companies grow, it is common for them to raise capital in multiple funding rounds. Each funding round involves issuing more shares, which consequently results in dilution. Keep in mind that a lower percentage of ownership of a more valuable company will be worth more.

5/ Last but not least - if you are in San Francisco, don't forget to try out the [NFT Restaurant](https://sf.eater.com/2022/6/1/23150217/san-francisco-nft-restaurant-club-sho).

Yes, the food is real - you don't just "taste it" in the metaverse 😅

See you next week. 🚀
