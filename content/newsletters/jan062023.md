üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Do you know what's **better than A.I.?**

**Pigeons.** üê¶

Trained pigeons can **detect cancer** in scans with a huge accuracy (99%)!

Here is an image of how they train them and the [link to the research.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141357)

All that we need now is pigeons that can draw profile pictures, and the A.I. revolution is done! üòÖ

<br>

2/ The app that creates **A.I. profile pictures** (_LensaAI_) made last month **$30M**üí∞

Let me say that again.

> $30M in a month.

Of course, the demand for A.I. photos has fallen, and they are going to make **$16M** this month (oh nooooo).


This is the perfect example of building something _fast_ to manage _demand_.

Do you want **$30M now** or **$20k per month "forever"**? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

<br>

3/ It's cute when people think that **NFTs** are over.

[China just released its national NFT marketplace that also manages ALL digital rights.](https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-s-first-national-nft-marketplace-to-launch-next-week-report)

China is preparing for a showdown with the U.S. in terms of blockchain, web3, and digital goods (Europe is still sleeping), and **2023** is going to be brutal!

<br>

4/ This story is about how **dedication** and **consistency** (and **network** and **luck**) can help you achieve anything you want.

[Fidias](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3tTW_eJTV___rSUkUMnl5w) is a YouTuber from Cyprus who is on a mission to **hug 100 famous people** as a challenge for his YouTuber channel. He has already hugged 99 people, and he wanted to hug **Elon Musk** for the final one! 

To achieve that, he followed Elon Musk for more than 60 days, but without luck. He even pitched tents outside **SpaceX** and **Twitter** offices but was kicked out by security multiple times
Everything showed that he would not make it, and people told him to give up.

And then it happened. 

Elon Musk was attending a World Cup match, and some kids approached him and asked him if he could hug Fidias. 

And Elon agreed. Just like that.

(The hug didn't happen yet, though. Let's see how it will end.)

5/ Oops. I almost forgot. üòÖ

This is the **first** newsletter of the new year.

**Happy 2023 everyone!** üéâ

Thank you for being with me in **2022**. I promise you **2023** will be 10X more EPIC and FUN.

We will make it be.

üîä [Snoop Dogg has said it perfectly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ehy1-6IuCg)

> I wanna thank me for believing in me. 
> I wanna thank me for doing all this hard work. 
> I wanna thank me for having no days off. 
> I wanna thank me for never quitting. 
> I wanna thank me for always being a giver and trying to give more than I receive. 
> I wanna thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. 
> I wanna thank me for just being me all the time.

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! üöÄ
