If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**🔗!

These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ What does _**"It is always sunny in Philadelphia"**_ has in common with **Web3**?

Rob McElhenney (one of the creators and actors of "It's always sunny") is starting a new Web3 Entertainment company (literally 7 minutes from my house) that focuses on storytelling. The idea is that decentralized writers will create IP and share profits from future revenues.

To participate, you cannot just buy the NFT, but you have to be selected by sending who is your favorite character.

The project is [pretty epic](https://adimverse.com/), and you should definitely check it out!

<br>

2/ Are you ready for the **strangest** business move of the week?

[Salesforce is starting its own NFT Platform.](https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/08/salesforce-takes-crypto-plunge-with-new-nft-cloud/)

Customers will be able to host, buy and sell NFTs using Salesforce, and I just have to ask, "why?" Any idea? 🤔

The best answers get ✌️**299 $Victory coins**!

<br>

3/ Crypto keeps crashing 📉 but tons of new **HUGE** players are entering the market. Maybe that's a signal?

A [new crypto trading platform](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-07/citadel-securities-virtu-form-crypto-plan-with-fidelity-schwab) is being built by Citadel, Fidelity, and Charles Schwab - the biggest financial companies in the US.

Maybe these guys know something that the rest of us don't know?

<br>

4/ Just a quick reminder to all founders out there! 

> If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.
> (_Reid Hoffman_)

💡 Don't let perfectionism ruins your progress. As soon as you have built an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), launch it and get valuable feedback from your customers!

You always can improve it in future iterations 😉

<br>

5/ Did you know that there are currently more than **10,000 cryptocurrencies**, divided into over **150 different categories**? It's a chaotic space! 🤯

Some of the most known crypto-sectors are; Metaverse, DeFi, Algorithmic Stablecoin, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Exchange, NFTs and Collectibles, DAO, Gaming, Move to Earn, Ethereum Ecosystem, Polygon Ecosystem, Solana Ecosystem, Yield Farming, and many more.

[Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/cryptocurrency-category/) has created an index for each cryptocurrency category. 📈 If you are unfamiliar with the term, a cryptocurrency index helps investors get exposure in specific sectors using a well-diversified pre-build crypto portfolio. These indices eliminate the risk and the knowledge required to invest in these markets.

🔹Did you know that there are multiple cryptocurrency indices to invest in❓

🔹Have you ever used one of them❓

🔹If yes, what's your favorite platform❓


📥 Hit reply and let me know 😉

See you next week. 🚀
