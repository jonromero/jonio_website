üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

**1/ These are the things that I did in the last three months:**

1. Sold my NFT Platform (_OMGDrops_). Full story and party details are coming soon.
2. I ran my second conference - [V as in MetaVerse](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/v-as-in-metaverse-the-biggest-web3-conference-for-creators-lands-in-greece-this-december) - and it was the biggest Web3 conference on the planet. The next one is this summer, and it is going to melt your brain.
3. Two of the Startups I invested in exited, and one gave me a **6x** üöÄreturn. Good times.
4. I traveled to Greece, Cyprus, and Dubai (I just came back), and all I did was have fun with friends and create content.
5. I started planning for my next project, which is going to take **12 years to complete**. ü´£

Of course, now I am trying to get back to building stuff, but the inertia is so strong.

Here are some things I do when I don't want to do stuff:

1. I **turn off my phone**, and I stop consuming ANY content. This forces my brain to go to a "bored" state which is a step before the "let's build cool stuff" state.
2. I **exercise** even more. If I am not going to build any life-changing products, I better build a life-changing body ;)
3. I **clean** my desk/space/room/house. I always get inspired to start by cleaning spaces, but I do my best work when there is a mess.
4. I **play video games**. Seriously. I play until I burn out. No idea why this works, but I think it is like yoga for my brain.


What are your things to get back to business?

2/ This summer, I am thinking of running the [Olympus Marathon](http://www.olympus-marathon.com/?fbclid=IwAR0Ti0vX1uZRw_hrCsef4uUeSq7Frr1x1tVzVU2gZtdfUbb9KnSVi2Ir-7A), specifically, the **15km** path called "The Eagles' Edge" ([check the video, it is spectacular](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7GvqVhJeLA), and I was wondering if you want to join me. Why?

1. It is going to be **epic**. The location is fantastic, and it is going to be painfully fun (the best kind of fun)
2. The night before (and after?), we are staying in a small Greek village. Maaaaybe we'll have a secret "V as in MetaVerse" there? Maybe not?
3. Running with friends is always fun, and it is 10x more fun running with me (because I am awesome).
4. I will be **recording** a mega-video, so if you want to become famous on my [YouTube channel](https://jon.io/youtube), this is your chance!

My friends [Athina](https://www.instagram.com/instathens/) and [Anni](https://www.instagram.com/annipan2310/) are already leading the "V Tribe" running team, so reply here, and let's get you to the team!

<br>

3/ The creator of **Stable Diffusion** has released a new plugin that transforms videos into videos. What does this mean?

[Check this video](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1622594989384519682?cxt=HHwWhMC-yfjizoQtAAAA) and expect some crazy videos coming soon!

<br>

4/ If you still haven't played around with the Stable Diffusion model, what are you doing with your time?


You are just a phrase away from creating awesome images and unleashing the artist in you. üë©‚Äçüé®

You can try the [demo here.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion)

**Pro-tip**; I know all demo environments are **limited**, and it's challenging to set up your environment to generate unique images using text-to-image AI models.

That's why I found another solution for you. üòâ

> [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com/) is the easiest way to generate AI art on your computer with Stable Diffusion. Completely free of charge. Runs offline. No limits.

Enjoy!

5/ Just 3 months after the release of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), Google announced the release of its own LLM (Large Language Model) called ["Bard"](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/).

But some (minor?) mistakes in Bard's presentation cost Alphabet (Google's parent company) about [$100 billion in market value](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/). Among the errors were a missing demo phone and incorrect information displayed in their new video chatbot demo.

Tell me about expensive mistakes! ü§ê


<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! üöÄ
