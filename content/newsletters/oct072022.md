üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **Liquid death**

This is not beer. It is actually water. And this water company is now valued at $700M because it nailed storytelling.

üîé This is how they did it.

The founder (Mike Cessario) was playing in heavy metal bands (before being the Creative Director at Netflix, working on tons of viral campaigns), and he saw that the majority of them were drinking water before going on stage.

But there is nothing worse than being **Metallica** and going with a lame bottle of Evian to play [Master of Puppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF4fmt15GaI), so he decided to put his water in a beer can.

But that's not it.

His message is **edgy**. Non-traditional AT ALL.

By using aluminum, Liquid Death's can is [more recyclable than plastic.](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/liquid-death-and-the-nonsense-of-packaged-water) This is the heavy metal album named "Greatest Hates" where the lyrics are [customer complains](https://loudwire.com/company-liquid-death-hateful-comments-metal-album/), and it is pure epicness.

Here is also an [excellent video to feel their vibe.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeRADNpdKD4)

And, of course, Tony Hawk gave his own blood to paint commemorative Liquid Death skateboards.

üëâ Liquid Death is the most exciting company, even if their product is just water. It is all about storytelling.

2/ Your weekly dose of **motivation** and boost is here! 

Everyone says that failure is part of the process, and they're right. 

> If you don't fail, you're not trying hard enough. 
 
But failure can get difficult from time to time. Here is another way to think about failure.

**Don't worry about failure; you only have to be right once.**

3/ **Interior AI**

I decorated the interior of the Acropolis using A.I. . And I love it.

Check this [Interior A.I](https://interiorai.com/), an app where you upload an image of your room, and it generates different interior designs.

There are tons of new apps that use A.I. to push your creativity to new levels, and you should definitely take advantage of them. ü§ì

By the way, I am literally redecorating my house and backyard üè° with this tool. I'll post updates on my [YouTube channel](https://jon.io/youtube) and [Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/jonvictory/)

<br>

4/ **Think long term**

üòï Are you trying to pursue many different directions at once? Are you frustrated that the world wants you to pick one thing because you want to do them all?

> The problem is thinking short-term ‚Äî assuming that if you don‚Äôt do all the things now, they won‚Äôt happen.

The solution is to think **long-term**. Do just one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another. 

Most people **overestimate** what they can do in one year and **underestimate** what they can do in ten years.

Think long-term. Use the future. ‚åõ

5/ **Zero-to-One** is one of the [greatest business books of all time.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)

The author, [Peter Thiel](https://twitter.com/peterthiel), is an entrepreneur worth more than 4.5 billion. He co-founded PayPal and Palantir Technologies & Founders Fund and was an early investor in iconic companies like Facebook.
