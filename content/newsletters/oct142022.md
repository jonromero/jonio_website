👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **Prompt Engineer** is the fastest-rising profession you haven't heard of and can learn in less than a day.

To explain what a prompt engineer does, let's talk about **Machine Learning.** 🤖

Last week [I spoke about using A.I. to decorate my house](https://jon.io/i-am-using-ai-to-decorate-my-house) using a new (simple) algorithm called _**Stable Diffusion**_.

These new machine learning models (Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney) are **text-to-image** algorithms.

It is not trivial to create a good prompt, but it is also not difficult. This image teaches you the basics of how to build a prompt.

For example, the image below was generated by putting this text (prompt) into the machine:

> Art by artgerm and Greg Rutkowski and Alphonse Mucha, and Jesper Ejsing, 'Hermes the God of Speed', lean muscular body, winged helmet, sun in the background, Greek mythology, intricate, cinematic lighting, epic scene, highly detailed, oil painting, hyperrealistic, concept art, sharp focus, illustration, 8K, --ar 9:16 --testp --upbeta --style 1

Hundreds of companies want **_prompts_** to create logos, products, designs, ideas, and marketing material and are looking for prompts.

Definitely, something to have on your radar. 📡

2/ The craziest idea to make **$10k in a month**: Sending horse poop to people. 🤯

Read [here the story of two guys](https://www.shitexpress.com/blog/how-we-earned-10120-usd-in-30-days-by-sending-horse-poop-to-people-amazing-kickstart-of-a-marketing-experiment/) and their company Shitexpress and their incredible journey - from building a prototype to gathering customer feedback to scaling.

Yes, scaling is **NOT** as easy as it sounds.

<br>

3/ Do you want to earn **10x more?** 💯

It doesn't matter what you do. All it matters is where you are.

This is the story on how to make 💰 **$200k by crafting tweets for a V.C.**

A VC in the U.S. (their name will not be shared) wanted more followers on Twitter. They thought about buying followers, but that is lame. They thought about writing interesting content, but that takes time.

They called their friend (who is an Entrepreneur) in Los Angeles and asked them:

> How **you** as a founder, find time to post on social media? You are surfing, acting, investing, running companies, building products - what is your magic bullet?

The Entrepreneur smirked and said:

> It is outsource b*tch.

The V.C. was taken aback. How this never crossed their mind?

They asked around the office, but no one had Twitter skills that "vibe". They approached someone on Twitter with 50k followers and asked them to name their price.

$200k. 💵

[Rumors say that this was the best investment this V.C. ever made.](https://www.businessinsider.com/ghostwriter-makes-200000-a-year-crafting-tweets-for-top-vcs-2022-10)

4/ There is a silly game called [Spotto](https://spottofederation.org/rules) we used to play with my family during long trips.🕹️

The rules are pretty simple: if you see a vehicle that is mostly yellow, shout out 'Spotto!' and score a point. Spotto is usually played during long trips, but it can also be played on the way to school. Any time is good for Spotto: the game that's Always On!


But what can this game teach us about life? 🤔

Well, playing the game long enough, you'll realize that **it's easy to spot a yellow car when you are always thinking of a yellow car.** 🚖

The same principle applies almost to everything. 

🔹 It is **easy** to spot opportunities when you are always thinking of opportunities.

🔹 It is **easy** to spot reasons to be mad when you are always thinking of being mad.

> You become what you constantly think about. Watch yourself.

<br>


5/ Do you believe in **luck**? Or do you believe in **hard work**?

In Greece 🇬🇷, we say,

> "if you have luck, go ahead!"

But in the U.S. 🇺🇸, we say,

> "The harder you work, the luckier you get."


Well, the sure thing is that **you need both luck and hard/smart work** to achieve your goals. But, one of them is directly determined by you, while the other is not in your hand. 

Choose wisely what you rely on 😉

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
