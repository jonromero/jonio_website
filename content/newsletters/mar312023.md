**1/ Someone saved his dog by using A.I.** 😮

Wow, can you believe it?

I read about this guy who [saved his dog's life using a chatbot](https://twitter.com/peakcooper/status/1639716822680236032?t=Whd6qZ7lG9ZFvRziaEFWxQ&s=19). All by typing the symptoms in a free website.

We live in crazy times.

**2/ Long distance relationship? No worries!**

Here is a creepy device to help you [make out with your partner](https://twitter.com/jonromero/status/1639029478172291073?t=LEvzLY27Vx-_CKvmux2Y0w&s=19).

Would you use it? 😘

**3/ I always thought that people are generally intelligent, but it seems that 50% are idiots.**

Like [these guys](https://www.businessinsider.com/nearly-half-american-workers-dont-take-all-their-pto-research-2023-3?utm_source=feedly&utm_medi) that don't use all their vacations because they are afraid they will fall behind.

I could post the reasons why this doesn't make sense, and you need to recharge, and life is more than work, but if you disagree, you are already an idiot, so what's the point? 🤷

**4/ Your obsession with perfection kills your progress.** 🚩

This is a common discussion I have with founders. And always come down to the need to focus on the right things.

Your role as a leader requires you to **focus on high-order priorities** rather than getting bogged down in the minutiae of smaller tasks. Striving for perfection in every task may actually hinder your overall progress, especially if you're dedicating your time to low-order priorities.

🎯 Doing the right thing imperfectly is much more valuable than perfectly executing the wrong something. To truly drive growth, shift your focus to these high-order priorities.

👉 Here is an example to always remember it. In binary math, you use bits — 0 or 1 — to express numbers. As a leader, your job is to flip the highest-order bit.

**5/ Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter**

> We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more potent than GPT-4.

Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Yuval Noah Harari, and other prominent figures propose a [6-month halt on AI experiments](https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/) beyond GPT-4, fearing human-competitive intelligence could soon threaten our existence.  

Despite the noble intentions, this seems unlikely. Major US tech firms might comply, but external pressures and non-US entities could undermine the effort, generating a Tragedy Of The Commons scenario.

_The tragedy of the commons refers to a situation in which individuals with access to a public resource (also called a common) act in their own interest and, in doing so, ultimately deplete the resource._

Plus, with impactful AI advancements possible by smaller innovators, containing the genie now seems improbable.

I'm very curious to see what comes next! 👀 

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week!
