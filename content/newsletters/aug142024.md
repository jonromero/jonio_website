## Made it in a Hollywood movie! 

And you can see me for almost 1 second!

This was part of my [Until It's Done](/my-13-year-project-until-it-is-done) crusade/project and it was a lot of fun. 

I'll upload a whole video about my experience and how much money I made (hint: around $130) - [click here to subscribe](https://jon.io/youtube). 


If you want to see the episode, I am on the first episode of Season 7 and it is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzOnjM3A4LI&t=1213s) (around 20:10) and on Paramount+.


## Are you happy?

Whoa! We jumped from a light topic to deep stuff!

This research as you can see in the smallest image I could find, categorizes why/how people are happy/unhappy.

If you don't want to squint, the number 1 trait that satisfied with life people have is:

> Have more fun. That's it.

Think something fun that you even wanted to do but you couldn't because you are saying bullshit excuses to yourself, and send me an email. Do it.

## I'll send you $50 if you ask an epic question

A week ago, I posted [on my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_ill-send-50-to-the-best-startupinvestment-activity-7226338219632603136-faO9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) that I'll give $50 to the best Startup/investment question.

I got tons of EPIC questions but before giving this $50 away, I thought that you might want to take a swing. 


So, ask your epic question here -> [https://asqme.com/@jonvictory](https://asqme.com/@jonvictory) and if selected, I'll send you $50. 

Also, I'll post all the questions next week because some of them were truly epic.

Stay epic
