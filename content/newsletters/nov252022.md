👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Qatar has spent **$220 BILLION** 🤯 on World Cup. That means:

1. It has spent **MORE** than its' GDP ($180 Billion)
2. It has spent **220 times MORE** than what the US spent in 1994 (or 160x more if you account for inflation)
3. Qatar could buy Twitter from Elon **4 times** (or 40 times if they bought it right now)
4. Qatar could give **$25 to EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON THE PLANET** (we are now $8 Billion people - no idea why I put the dollar sign in front, we are just people!)
5. Qatar could give you all this money, and still, you don't have enough money to start a company!


🧐 What would you do with this money?

2/ **Do you know what kills a relationship?**

Here is how a researcher found a simple game to protect it.

**Lack of gratitude** is the silent killer of a relationship, and there is a simple game called:

> The Gratitude tennis.

It is super simple and goes like this:

* _**Player 1**_ serves up something they are grateful for.
* _**Player 2**_ must "return" the gratitude with something they are grateful for.
* Repeat "serving" gratitudes back to all the players until the 3-min timer goes off.

I first [heard about it here](https://twitter.com/mattschnuck/status/1595084964239798272?t=TeUB_aEb3F14ObJJjWrkhQ&s=19), and after reading more about it, it seems that a lack of gratitude can also kill friendships, office vibes, etc.

**Start playing tennis!** 🎾

3/ **If you've been wondering whether we live in a simulation, now there is an answer.**

Ok, actually, not **now**, but at least someone is [trying to prove it.](https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientist-crowdfunding-experiment-simulation)

Proving that this life is a simulation (or a parallel dimension - 982 for those that know) is easy - in theory.

We just need to find a lot of **inconsistencies** in our reality (like WHY we keep losing one sock from a pair).

[This researcher went a little further](https://futurism.com/the-byte/scientist-crowdfunding-experiment-simulation) and wants to build a machine that will tell us whether posting angry tweets makes any difference in the grand scheme of life.

And in case you read that far, you can claim **982 $Victory coins** ✌️ if you find which dimension we are in.

For example, if we are in the `999th` dimension, add 999 at the end of the URL like this:

<https://victory.jon.io/claim/999>

You can try jumping here if we are not in the same dimension.

4/I'm super excited as we are approaching `Dec 16, 2022`, when **the biggest Web3 / Metaverse conference will happen in Athens, Greece.** 🇬🇷

If you want to attend epic talks, network with the community, win a hackathon, and maybe land your next job as a web3 engineer, this is the best place for you!

Join us in ["V as in MetaVerse 2022"](https://jon.io/metaverse2022) and get ready for a fantastic event!

PS: Please, share the site, share anything you liked from this email and let's try to make Athens the center of Web3, storytelling, and innovation!
