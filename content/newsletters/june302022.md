If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**üîó!

These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ A crypto company was valued at **$5 Billion** and is getting sold for **$250M** to **$25M** üìâ in less than a year. I am talking about **BlockFI**.

And you know how much I LOVE cringe videos, especially when it has to do with crypto - like the [4 Billion $ in Bitcoin hackers.](https://jon.io/the-hackers-that-were-really-rappers-and-job-security)

[The latest one comes from BlockFI](https://twitter.com/gordolven/status/1540846274055786496?s=20&t=JbmtM1_SpQ4bPTp0m6Fpig), and it has to do with their fundraising.

The crypto/web3 space is like a soap opera on steroids!

<br>

2/ Pretty heavy accusations towards one of the biggest NFT projects - **Bored Apes** - are flying around, along [with lawsuits](https://decrypt.co/103799/bored-ape-founders-nazi-disinformation-campaign-demented-troll).

Conspiracy theories, Nazi symbols, mystical gateways to another dimension, and tons of money.

Have you followed the story? What's your opinion? ü§î

<br>

3/ There is a saying in the Startup world: **Go big or go home.** üöÄ

Many entrepreneurs don't understand that to be the best, you just have to be the best. No need for hard work.

Does the lion have to work to be a lion? Or a giraffe? Or an armadillo?

Take my advice and see my latest video.

Please **subscribe**, **like** and **share it** - it would mean a lot to me! üôè

<br>

4/ Do you know what a [Product Owner](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-product-owner) is? What about the Product Manager? 

What are the [differences between these 2 roles](https://www.productplan.com/learn/product-manager-vs-product-owner/)? Do you need to hire a Product guy for your Tech startup, or is it better to hire another engineer?

In this üì∞ article, our Chief of Chaos describes the [core responsibilities and skills required for a successful Product Owner.](https://medium.com/@papaemman.pan/what-is-a-product-owner-po-86f800f479cb)

**Enjoy!**

<br>

5/ Do you want to practice Artificial Intelligence (specifically **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**) and don't know where to start?

Right now, **Python** üêç is the go-to language for anything related to Data Science and AI. The following packages give you functionalities worth millions of dollars, if not more, for **FREE**. Salute to the **open-source community**!

1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Plotly
6. Scikit-Learn
7. SciPy
8. TensorFlow
9. PyTorch
10. XGBoost
11. LightGBM

<br>

See you next week. üöÄ
