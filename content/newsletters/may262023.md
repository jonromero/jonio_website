👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ Ad

This is the Greek TV ad for my conference. And it's made by me!

Let me tell you about my train of thought and why it looks so **different**.

I got inspired by the [Reddit Ad during the Superbowl](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/business/media/reddit-super-bowl-ad.html). Five seconds of brilliance. 🤩  

That told me that I have to go for something that hooks the viewer for at least 5 seconds. That's why the music starts immediately.

You see someone throwing money, and by the time your brain processes what's going on, you see a guy in a kimono lifting weights (that's me!).

The font changes so you can focus on the dates and the website.  

**15 seconds.** ⏳ That's it.

Watch the full ad [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbcgJDJzHiI) and leave a comment!

## 2/ Einstein

If you are an Entrepreneur and you are feeling down, remember that [Einstein launched a refrigerator company](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_refrigerator) but didn't make it.

Keep building. 🔥

<br>

## 3/ A little push to start.

I'm sure you have a brilliant idea 💯 that has been circling around your mind for a long time now, but you haven't taken any action on it yet.

And, if you continue to just let it be an idea, it won't amount to anything more than that. 💀

I understand that **moving from idea to execution** can be daunting for many people.

That's why I'd like to offer some practical advice on how to get started:

1.  Find a name for your idea.
2.  Purchase the domain for your website.
3.  Apply for 1 of the 3 major Technology and Cloud providers' **startup programs.** ✅

By joining their programs, you'll gain access to a wide range of benefits to help you start building your idea for free.

*   [Google for Startups](https://startup.google.com/)
*   [AWS for Startups](https://aws.amazon.com/startups/)
*   [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups)  

To get more info and a solid plan, subscribe to my ["Built to Fail" email course](https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail).

It's for FREE and super valuable!

## 4/ Memory

Have you ever gotten **SO ecstatic** about something that you forgot it?

Last year during my conference, I had some friends telling me that they ❤️ **loved it,** but it seems they don't remember some parts of it.

And no, they were not smoking anything weird. 😬

I was reading about how to make sure to make this year's event ( [don't forget to sign up](https://jon.io/vaim) ) **unforgettable,** and surprisingly Taylor Swift had the same issue.

[The Taylor Swift memory hole](https://time.com/6282468/taylor-swift-concert-memory/) happens when you are waaaay too excited, and your brain doesn't retain any information.

Interesting how our brains work (or sometimes don't). 😉

## 5/ Twitter Lists

Twitter is a free university, but most people don't know how to use it or find themselves overwhelmed by the vast amount of information there.

💡 Tip: **Twitter Lists** offer a useful tool for organizing and prioritizing the tweets you see in your timeline. You can join existing lists created by others or create your own lists based on specific interests or topics.

If you are into **Analytics, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**, this is the only Twitter list you're gonna need.

👉 [Data Science Twitter List](https://lnkd.in/dkYFW6mg)
 
Our Chief of Chaos manages this list daily, ensuring that it is up-to-date and high-quality!


Over 150+ people have already followed it. Enjoy! ✌️

That's all for now. See you next week!
