Here we go with the Top 5 things that happened last week.


1/ It has become a tradition by now, to have one **huge** thing happening in the DAO space every week. This is the [fourth newsletter](https://jon.io/how-to-win-without-talent-making-money-and-metaverse-cities) and trust me on this, I am not even talking about 1/64 of what is happening out there.



I started helping out [CityDAO](https://www.citydao.io/) with their Constitution smart contract and just like that I started another DAO, called DAOCracy.



There are tons of people helping out already, we had two community calls and I love it! If you want to participate and learn about web3, NFTs, the metaverse and how to work for a DAO, drop by our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ePSSJdzfqA) (channel #the-dao). I promise you, this DAO is for new people to learn more about this crazy new space.



2/ In the meanwhile, [El Salvador decided to create a "Bitcoin City"](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/22/el-salvador-plans-bitcoin-city-raise-1-billion-via-bitcoin-bond.html) and raise $1 billion via "Bitcoin Bond". Translation: **Scam**.



There is no city being build that is not on the Ethereum blockchain and not using NFTs. Building a Bitcoin City makes as much sense as building a city using rocks. You can do it but you are probably an idiot. In this case, you cannot even build a city with Bitcoin as you cannot do any transactions and there are no smart contracts.



3/ And we are back with our [weekly pitch deck reviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH-ZrHCkXzo)!



This time I am reviewing a pretty solid Startup, with a very impressive technology. If I could change only one thing in their pitch deck that would be ... (come on, [watch the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXduZ4VdXCs)!).



Oh and if you haven't subscribed to the channel, **DO IT NOW**.

4/ If you don't know Mr Beast, oh you are in for a surprise. An excellent creator, that creates super viral videos. His last video is [Squid Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg). 135 Million views in 7 days. Yes, he had more viewers that the actual Squid games.



If you want to create viral content, study him (I know I am!).



5/ The founder of Twitter left Twitter. But that's not the big news. Jack Dorsey is also the founder of Square (a huge fintech company) that is now [rebranding to Block](https://www.reuters.com/technology/dorsey-led-square-rebrands-block-2021-12-01/). Yes Block as in **Block**chain.



If you are still working for a web2 company, you have to **immediately** reevaluate your choices. Join a DAO, and start reading as much as you can.



> If you want to have a job in the future, you need to start working for the "future" - someone I don't remember


See you next week!
