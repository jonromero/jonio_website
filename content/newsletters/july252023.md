👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ OpenVC

The question I get the most is, **"Where can I find funding** 💰 **for my Startup"?**

🌐 Just go to [OpenVC](https://www.openvc.app/) and enjoy!  

Let me know about your experience!

## 2/ Luck

I like making my own **luck**. 🍀

Oh, did you know that there are [4 types of luck](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1683087961104044034?s=20)?

1.  **Systemic (Blind) Luck** => Out of your control (like the place you were born)
2.  **Luck in motion** => You create luck because you keep exploring
3.  **Strategic luck** => You are aware of your surroundings and opportunities, and you act
4.  **Luck of Authenticity** => You are unique, and you embrace it, and then luck **finds** you.

## 3/ Kill It Before It Kills You.

No, I'm not talking about actual murders here; I'm referring to your **startup idea**.

Let's say you have an **idea**, and you start building your startup the right way\*:

1.  You start with an idea 💡
2.  You validate your idea (without spending any money).
3.  You build a landing page for your product.
4.  You find your first 10 customers.

So far, so good.

You decide to start building an actual product, work with some engineers, and burn some money on marketing campaigns.

But then, **nothing** happens. 😐 You can't gain any traction, and you've tried everything, but the market doesn't want your product.  

📌 You have two options here: **keep pushing further** or **kill your project and move on to the next one.**

Don't worry; even Google kills their no-go projects.

When I feel down, I go to the [Killed By Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/). It's basically a graveyard of projects that didn't meet expectations, and Google decided to shut them down.

You are probably not better than Google, so kill it before it kills you and move on.

\*Don't know what "the right way" is?

🌐 Here is my FREE course ([Course: Build to Fail](https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail)), where I teach you what I've learned after building tons of companies for many years.

## 4/ Twitter Killed the bird? ✘

Twitter has [removed the iconic bird logo and adopted 'X'](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/twitter-has-officially-changed-its-logo-to-x/) as its official logo.

I don't know what Elon is thinking, but I know for sure that he is **obsessed with the letter X**.

*   25 years ago, he founded **X.com**, which eventually became PayPal.
*   His space startup **SpaceX** has "X" as the logo.
*   His son with Grimes is named **"X Æ A-12"**
*   He founded an AI company called **X.ai**.

And now, Twitter changed its legal name from Twitter Inc. to **X Corp**, along with its logo. ([X.com](http://X.com) now points to [twitter.com](http://twitter.com/)).

I'm curious. What do you think is so special about X?
