👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Can a YouTuber go from **nothing** to generating **$100M in revenue** from selling ... burgers? 🍔

Let me introduce you to [MrBeast](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000).

Besides having many different channels with millions of subscribers and more than 1700 ghost kitchens selling his _**"MrBeast Burger"**_, he is now [fundraising at a $1.5B valuation](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/25/mrbeast-youtube-fundraising-merch-restaurants). And to tell you the truth, it doesn't seem that high.

Multiple sources of income, multiple flywheels, very strong brand, and non-stop product lines.

Have you heard about MrBeast? What's your take?

<br>

2/ Is **Netflix** crazy?

Everyone knew that Netflix was planning to enter the game market as they added games inside their app, but the latest news shows that it is [ready to launch a full cloud gaming platform](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/netflix-cloud-gaming-confirmed). 🎮

That means that Netflix will try to succeed where [Google failed](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/01/stadia-died-because-no-one-trusts-google/).

<br>

3/ While Netflix is preparing to launch a gaming platform, it's time for **TikTok** to "join the game"!

[TikTok is releasing free games through their app](https://9to5mac.com/2022/10/27/tiktok-gaming-2/) next week, something that they have already tested in Vietnam.

The gaming industry is a huge and perfect fit for an audience that loves "short" entertainment.

I wonder whether TikTok will release a game console. 🕹️

<br>

4/ Well, it finally happened. From today, [Elon Musk officially owns Twitter!](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/27/elon-musk-bought-twitter/) 😮

It's for real this time. After months of legal drama and bad memes, Elon Musk has closed his $44 billion 💰 acquisition of Twitter. Musk sealed the deal Thursday night, taking Twitter private and ousting a handful of top executives — CEO Parag Agrawal included — in the process.

I don't know what the future has in store for one of the world's biggest social networks, but I know this acquisition will begin a new era at Twitter!


5/ Do you want an **easy life**? Then you need to do the **hard things** first!

_The easy path today makes a hard path tomorrow. The hard path today makes an easier path tomorrow._
