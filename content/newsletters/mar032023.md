1/ I am trying to train a **crow,** and this is not the strangest thing I've ever done!

Crows are intelligent, and I was wondering what would happen if I started feeding them at a specific time of the day.

I've read online that after a while, they might accept you and even bring you gifts. So, every day at 9 am, I started putting some seeds. And every day, in 10 minutes, these seeds were gone.

Today, I decided to install a camera and see my (almost) trained friend in action.

Sadly, things are not going great 🙂

2/ **Experiment: Control my mind for a week.**
 
I have a **Google Hub Max on my kitchen counter,** and I use it for calls (it is epic) and seeing photos as a slideshow.

The slideshow is generated either by pictures I take with my phone (and contains faces of specific people - AI is awesome) or it is a shared album where people whom I have given access upload photos. 📸

This slideshow sets my **intentions** **for the day.**  

So, what would happen if I create a shared album and anyone can add their photos?

Let's try it out! Use [this link](https://photos.app.goo.gl/d94PSqmiXf7Ramvh9) and **upload photos that make you happy** 🤩 and hopefully will also make my day.

Obviously, I've never done this before, so in case the link doesn't work, just send me your photos via _email_.

I'll pick a random person and send them **1000 ✌ $Victory!**

**3/ After I sold my last company, I knew it was time to do something bigger.**

Way bigger.

Something that if it fails, the echoes will travel around the earth like **Superman** 🦸🏻‍♂️ in that old movie where he was trying to save Lois Lane.

I've talked in my previous newsletters about my **12-year project** (that will be announced on the 4th of April), and this next project is just a **SMALL** part of it.

But let's cut to the chase.

🎥 On the 12th of March, we are making a **short movie.** **In 3 hours**. During the Oscars. And you can be in that movie even if you are not in Los Angeles.

The duration of the final movie is going to be 40+ minutes.

What's the story? I don't know yet.

🔷 All I know is that if you are in LA, expect food, drinks, and the best three hours of your life.

🔷 If you are not in LA, you can join and act through Google Meet.

Let's make a (short) movie! 🎬

**4/ Without data, you're just another person with an opinion.**

Next time you will have an **argument** with someone, think about the previous sentence. Do you have data to support your claim? Does the other person have data?

Most of the time, neither of the 2 has data because, as Edwards Deming said, "Data avoids arguments."

Without data, personal biases and opinions dominate decision-making. Let's focus on gathering data and experimenting with making better decisions, and avoiding unnecessary disagreements.
