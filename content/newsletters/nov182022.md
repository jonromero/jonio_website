If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**üîó!

üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **Do you want to stay for FREE with the founder of Airbnb in his apartment in SF?**

You can go together to the gym, chat about Startups and make a new friend!

Yes, [this is not a joke.](https://fortune.com/2022/11/17/you-can-stay-airbnb-ceo-brian-chesky-home-0-bake-cookies-be-gym-buddy/)

Brian Chesky (the CEO of Airbnb), to prove that Airbnb is safe, is opening up his personal home for random people at a **zero** price.

> I did it 15 years ago, and I‚Äôm going to do it again

Before trying to find the listing, it is booked until March 2023!

<br>

2/ If you want to earn some money while building cool software and partying with other builders, there is a month left before my conference ["V as in MetaVerse"](https://jon.io/metaverse2022) starts!

This week, the (free) tickets for the hackathon will be released, and OMG, you have no idea what will happen. If you also want a 1-on-1 with me in Athens, leave a comment below!

Go to the [website](https://jon.io/metaverse2022), sign up to get the notifications, and get set!

Thank you, [TheEgg](https://www.theegg.gr/en/), for the location!

3/ **You'll be able to buy NFTs from Instagram pretty soon!** üñºÔ∏è

Why should you care?

Meta is already testing [selling NFTs with selected influencers](https://www.engadget.com/meta-creators-can-sell-nfts-directly-on-instagram-220049106.html), and the plans are to integrate them with an "inner circle" service.

Owning the NFT means you'll have access to an OnlyFans experience (minus the nudity - maybe?). Meta seems to be committed to their web3 strategy, weeks after they shut down their hardware line (Portal and their watches) and firing more than 10.000 people.

<br>

4/ A lot of stuff has been happening on **Twitter** since Elon Musk bought it. And many of them are not getting known to the public.

But since you are a reader of this newsletter, you know where to go to learn insights about the biggest tech companies in the world.

It looks like Twitter has been the hottest topic in the tech industry for the last couple of days.

<br>

5/ Have you ever slept 7+ hours but still felt exhausted?

Did you know that there are actually [7 different types of rest](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/productivity-hacks-li_how-to-turn-rest-into-productivity-activity-6983408987073331200-TKoR/)? And you need to get each one of them to feel refreshed and be efficient in your life.

1. Physical Rest
2. Mental Rest
3. Social Rest
4. Spiritual Rest
5. Sensory Rest
6. Emotional Rest
7. Creative Rest

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! üöÄ
