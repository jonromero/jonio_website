👉 It's **Chief of Chaos** ([Panos Papaemmanouil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-papaemmanouil/)) at _"Jon V enterprises"_ writing. 
This week, I took the lead to tell you about all the recent exciting advancements in the **AI** field! Let's dive into it. 🚀

<br>

1/ First things first, I bet you all are familiar with the quote from [Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/)

> The Software is eating the world.

He predicted more than 10 years ago (in 2011!) that **software companies would disrupt traditional industries**. And he was right! ✅

Since then, we have seen multiple technology companies confirming this prediction and becoming the market leaders in their respective fields (Amazon, Google, Netflix, Shopify, and many more).

But now we are in **2022**, and in the last few years, humanity has witnessed unprecedented growth in the developments in AI. 🧠

Although several key ideas about AI have been around for a long, many processes have accelerated their potential use.

1. **Computing power** has vastly increased, particularly for specialized AI chipsets.
2. The amount of **training data** for AI algorithms is exploding with the advent of data lakes and a fully connected internet-of-things world, expanding AI domains and decreasing the costs to train algorithms.
3. Many **technological bottlenecks** have been solved over the last few years, massively increasing the accuracy and applicability of existing algorithms.
4. The decrease in **cloud storage and computing costs**, plus the facilitation of distributed collaborative working, made combining highly specialized knowledge more accessible.

🔥 So, it's time to move on.


As Nvidia's CEO, [Jensen Huang, predicted a few years ago](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/05/12/151722/nvidia-ceo-software-is-eating-the-world-but-ai-is-going-to-eat-software/)

> Software Is Eating the World, but AI Is Going to Eat Software


And the time has come for this prediction to come true! ⏳

2/ [Open AI](https://openai.com/) is one of the most influential AI companies in the world. Their mission is to **ensure that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.**


For the last 2 years, Open AI has developed the most advanced AI systems and made them [available to the public.](https://beta.openai.com/overview)


1. [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/): Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system that approaches human-level robustness and accuracy in English speech recognition. 🌐 You can try it [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/whisper). 
2. [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/): is an AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. 🌐 You can try it [here](https://labs.openai.com/). 
3. [GPT-3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3): GPT stands for "Generative Pretrained Transformer". It is a language model that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text. It can be used for various natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbot development. GPT models are trained on a large amount of data and can generate high-quality, coherent text. 🌐 You can try it [here](https://beta.openai.com/playground).
4. [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) is a natural language-to-code system based on GPT-3, which helps to turn simple English instructions into over a dozen popular coding languages. 🌐 You can try it [here](https://beta.openai.com/playground?model=code-davinci-002&prompt=%22%22%22%0AAsk%20the%20user%20for%20their%20name%20and%20say%20%22Hello%22%0A%22%22%22).
5. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) is the newest AI system developed by Open AI. It is a revolutionary tool for Conversation Generation. It is designed to interact with the user conversationally, answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. 🌐 You can try it [here](https://chat.openai.com/chat).

If you have yet to try these models, **you should definitely do it!**

I promise you; they will blow your mind! 🤯

3/ **Why do Academics hate ChatGPT?**

While everyone is excited about advancements in the AI field and **ChatGPT** in particular, [Academics do not feel the same](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability). 

They have a huge problem now, as all the normal assessment techniques have become irrelevant! 😮

📌 **ChatGPT** can quickly write essays for any topic, solve take-home assignments, and complete homework in minutes.

And the most important part?

It can do all that without violating **copyright rules**, as it can generate original text and not just copy from other sources.

On the same side, Stack Overflow, the go-to question-and-answer site for coders and programmers, has [temporarily banned users from sharing responses generated by the AI chatbot ChatGPT](https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/5/23493932/chatgpt-ai-generated-answers-temporarily-banned-stack-overflow-llms-dangers). 

👉 I cannot stress enough how significant the release of ChatGPT is. The existence of this model will force humanity to rethink how we do a lot of things.

4/ **Unlock Unlimited possibilities with AI**

If you are still trying to convince yourself about the value of these AI tools, the following examples will blow your mind.

🔹 **Google search vs. ChatGPT**

Well, ChatGPT can easily replace Google search for a massive amount of queries. [Check the difference in response quality](https://twitter.com/jdjkelly/status/1598021488795586561?s=20&t=gKmge-zdPdws7ZNw_yKr8A) for this query.

"In LaTeX, how do I represent a differential equation?"


🔹 **Combine AI tools**

You can ask **ChatGPT** to write **prompts** for you and pass them to **DALL-E 2** to create extraordinary images. [How amazing is that?](https://twitter.com/GuyP/status/1598020781065527296?s=20&t=imd63bS3mXO5y3iep849Og)


🔹 **Design new proteins **

Scientists are already using these models for [designing new proteins on demand not seen in nature](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/01/1064023/biotech-labs-are-using-ai-inspired-by-dall-e-to-invent-new-drugs/).


📌 Here is a Twitter **thread** with excellent examples of ChatGPT.

You only need to know what questions to ask (and how to ask them), and you are ready to unlock a whole new world of infinite possibilities. **"Prompt engineer"** is the job of the future! 🦾

5/ I'm sure you have seen this trend all over the internet where people post **AI-generated pictures** of their selves.

**But how does this AI works?** 🤔

These apps use a particular type of neural network known as **Stable Diffusion** 🎨 to map a user's facial features and produce dozens of portraits in various art styles, like fantasy, science fiction, or anime. 👩🏻‍🎨

[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-v2-release) is a deep-learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions. However, it can also be applied to tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

💡 [Stable Diffusion's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) code and model weights have been [released publicly](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), and it can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest GPU with at least 8 GB VRAM. 👩🏻‍💻 This marked a departure from previous proprietary text-to-image models such as **DALL-E** and **Midjourney**, which were accessible only via cloud services.

📱 The most viral app to do this is called **"Lensa"**, and it's available on iOS and Android. Lensa AI works by inviting users to **upload 10-20 photos** of themselves. Using the open-source Stable Diffusion model, the app processes your images to generate avatars of you that look like a digital artist created them.

However, before using this app (or any other similar one), you should know that there are [ethical and legal concerns](https://news.northeastern.edu/2022/12/09/portrait-ai-app/#:~:text=With%20Lensa%2C%20users%20upload%2010,or%20anime%2C%20within%2020%20minutes) (as happens with every new technology). People have expressed their thoughts about the [future of digital artists](https://twitter.com/megraeart/status/1598806459004985363) and the potential biases of these apps.

Here is a [quick guide](https://www.techadvisor.com/article/1422944/use-lensa-app-ai-selfie-images.html]) if you want to try it yourself.

**Note:** you'll need to pay 💸 to use this app.


That's all for now. 🤩

What a time to be alive! 🔥
