If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**🔗!

<br>

✅ If you opened it and you are now reading this email, it means that my **"email subject"** game is top-notch (I talked about this [last week](https://jon.io/my-biggest-idea-ever-yet)).

But seriously, this is **goodbye**. To be less dramatic (like I could ever be less dramatic!) is a temporary goodbye. 🔜

I will spend some time in **Goa** (that's in India) doing some deep meditation and self-exploration 🧘, and I'll be back this summer for **Olympus Run** and the **V Conference**. Maybe.
  
But this newsletter won't stop! My friend [Victor Chase](https://www.instagram.com/iamvictorchase/) and my **Chief of Chaos** will continue posting, and sometimes I'll post from the jungle (is Goa a jungle? I have no idea).

<br>

Now let's continue with some **fast updates:** 

<br>

1/ It is impossible for me to read and respond to emails at this moment. I get **500 emails _per day_** _,_ so the best bet to get a response is to say something positive or awesome and keep it short. I respond to ALL emails, but it will take some time.

<br>

2/ Last week, I was [organizing a short movie](https://jon.io/my-biggest-idea-ever-yet) that had to be canceled due to a bank in the **Silicon Valley shutdown** 😬. Victor Chase will make sure this happens pretty soon.

<br>

3/ Last week, I asked everyone to [upload photos to this album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/d94PSqmiXf7Ramvh9) so I could see them in my kitchen. And you did. And it is awesome! 🤩  

Some quick stats:

*   Close to **200 pictures**
*   Zero dick picks

If you uploaded a picture, respond to this email, and I'll send you **$Victory coins.** ✌️

Please, continue uploading pictures! They'll keep me warm in Goa (seriously, what's even the weather in Goa? 🤔)
  
<br>

4/ Tons of videos are coming soon. Videos from the **MetaVerse**, videos from **Dubai**, **Cyprus**, **Greece,** and so many epic stories for your eyes only. 🔥

<br>  

5/ If you are new to this email, you can read TOOOOONS of content [here](https://jon.io/category/newsletters), and rest assured, **Victor Chase** and **Chief Of Chaos** have toooons of surprises coming up.

<br>

**_Thank you, I love you._**  

**_Όλη η αγάπη, όλη η δύναμη._**

<br>

**\- Jon V (as in Victory)** 🚀
