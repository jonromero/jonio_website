** Second Marathon **  

I am proud to announce that I just finished my SECOND MARATHON! [Read the epic post with details, photos and breakdown here](https://jon.io/i-hate-running-so-i-run-two-marathons) .


** "Shark Tank" from Temu **

A Greek founder didn't get money from an investment show - and maybe that's on me :(



A week ago, a friend of mine told me that she was going to be on a TV investment show/game in Greece (think shark tank but lame) and she asked me if I can do a small video to talk about her. 



And I did an EPIC video.



But there was ONE issue. 



At the end of the video, I commited that I'll match ALL the money the "sharks" will invest because 1) I believe in this founder 2) I believe female founders are under-represented in Greece.



The production refused to include the video because THE SHARKS MIGHT BE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION.



I don't want to dive into conspiracies that the "sharks" don't actually invest and it is just a show but COME ON!



The video is epic. I kid you not - [you can see the full video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKaGzjGRjLU). It is in Greek but I think you can enable english subtitles.



What do you think about this whole story?

That's all for now. See you next week!
