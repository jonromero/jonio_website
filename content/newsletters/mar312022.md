**These are the highlights of the past week!**

<br>

1/ Every three months, I sit down and write down ✍️ my commitments for the next quarter. **No goals. Commitments.**

🎯 With goals, you can wish about the outcome and maybe create a plan of action, but the reality is that the universe doesn't care about your feelings.

For me, the thing that I consider a **superpower is commitment**, and I've talked about it many times.

When you commit, it is a holy bond between you and yourself—no external help. If you fail, it was because **you** and only you failed. There is no chance, luck, or however you call it. No one to hold you down or mess up your mojo.

On the other side, you get no luck breaks or outside help. Well, you cannot have it all.

If you have never tried it before, write down something you really want to achieve and consciously commit to it. Don't go big before you have exercised your "commitment" muscle.

For example:

1. I'll go for a run every morning for 30 days
2. I won't eat sugar for 6 months
3. I will write a blog post every week for a year

Try it, and I guarantee you that you'll be unstoppable 🔥 after committing to a couple of things. If you cannot bring yourself down, no one can.

2/ This week, I have a [YouTube live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw), and I am **building LIVE a smart contract for a Decentralized Exchange.**

It will not be a hardcore engineering video as I plan to include many product development and marketing details, so if you are not an engineer, come, chill and ask your heart out.

I'll go over:

1. OpenZeppelin libraries and why you should be using them
2. Remix
3. Sending tokens to a contract, and why it doesn't work?
4. Deploying on the blockchain (Ethereum and Polygon)
5. Creating an API in the smart contract for our web3 app

[Come and say hi!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw) I'll be giving away some free tokens too!

<br>

3/ Last time I talked about the [$750k salaries of web3 engineers](https://jon.io/750k-salaries-and-raising-money-with-nfts) and I got a lot of messages that said something like:

> I have a team in <insert your favorite outsource country> that does smart contracts for $1k.

Well, the challenge with smart contracts is that if you are not a senior engineer, you might **end up losing a lot of money for the company.**

[Like $625M.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/29/23001620/sky-mavis-axie-infinity-ronin-blockchain-validation-defi-hack-nft)

Web3 development is one of the very few jobs where you wouldn't like to outsource due to price. Only for scarcity. Learn how to build on web3 as your job depends on it. Because it probably does.

4/ Making money 💸 from a side hustle is ridiculously easy. In case you haven't done it already, sign up for my [free email course that teaches you the basics of how to build a side gig.](https://jon.io/pages/built-to-fail)

I plan to release my **full course** 📚 in the next couple of months, and we'll all sit together and show you how to do a business that makes $1k per month. In one month.

Until then, [here is an example.](https://twitter.com/landforce/status/1509191770541723649?t=0IRGvUbtJYKqtcs3VYw0wQ&s=19)

Have you taken my free course in the past❓ Would you subscribe to the new one❓

<br>

5/ Last week, an astronaut 👨‍🚀 walked for seven hours in space. Alone. In the freaking space.

It blows my mind that we built a whole base in outer space, and we have people walking around doing errands.

We take for granted how far we've been as a species and what we can accomplish when working together.
