## Sunlight as a service

Yes, you can hire a company that has big mirrors in the sky and can shine a 5km sunlight wherever you tell them.

Yes the human race is so advanced that we can do that - even if it makes no sense. Just for the flex. [The company is here](https://www.reflectorbital.com/lighting) and I already sign up to have it shine on my backyard and terrify the neighbors. 


## A.I me!

[This is me. A.I me](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C--1fpGPSVZ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==). There is a tool that you upload 10 seconds of your voice and then creates a virtual avatar of yourself that can talk in ANY LANGUAGE you want (except the language of love).
