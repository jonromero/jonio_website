👉 This week's newsletter is going to be a little bit **different**.

Instead of the 5 topics I learned during the past week, I will focus on **1 HUGE thing I'm building right now**.

<br>

### I always wanted to build an NFT ticketing platform!

And finally, the time has come! ⏰

<br>

> For the next 14 days, I'm going to build an NFT platform where you can sell (and buy) NFT Tickets as part of [Polygon's Hackathon.](https://buidlit.polygon.technology)

<br>

The **RULES** 📜 are simple:

1. No wallet is required to create an NFT
2. No wallet is required to use the ticket
3. No gas fees (I will be paying for gas fees)
4. No special hardware is needed to scan tickets

<br>

But wait, I didn't tell you the best part! 

I will share the whole process with you, posting 1 Devlog daily 📹 for the next 2 weeks on my YouTube channel!
