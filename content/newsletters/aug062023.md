👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## 1/ Nameless

Someone - who I'll not name - destroyed the sacred **Temple of Artemis**. The reason? For everyone to remember his name.

But then a law was created ([Damnation Memorial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae)) that forbids people ever to speak his name - or even write it.

All this happened **2400** years ago in Ancient Greece. 🏛️

Did it work?

The answer comes from another "law", in 2003, in Malibu, California, called [Streisand Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect), which says:

> If you try to hide something, Internet will blast it out.

## 2/ Fly

A couple of days ago, I read the story of the [longest flight](https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/longest-ever-continuous-flight-1959/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2th-TEaGStDgZELJsIjT0ztgCQjWJwb73zPwsl5R0dUpG2q7j9cfwPqZs) ever, and it blew my mind - it was almost 65 days of non-stop flying. ✈️

What I really enjoyed was the ingenuity of the team and that after they landed, they had to be carried away. 😳  

Humans are crazy!

## 3/ Social jetlag

You heard about **jetlag** but how about [social jetlag](https://www.indy100.com/science-tech/experts-sleep-same-time-every-night)?

I've started following Bryan Johnson (the billionaire that spends $2M per year and tries to reverse aging) - check his [YouTube](https://youtu.be/NdZHo3xuZvw); it's good stuff - and I saw that he is fixated on sleeping at the same time. 😴

Recent research shows that moving our sleeping schedule, even by **90 minutes**, seriously impacts our health.

And as an Entrepreneur, my sleeping schedule has a deviation of **2 hours** at least (even more during the summer).

What's your sleeping schedule? Any tricks to share? 🧐

## 4/ Google Calendar Appointments

If you're anything like me, you know the importance of staying organized with your calendar. 🗓️

As I always say,

> "If it's not on my calendar, it probably won't happen."

But what happens when you need to schedule a meeting with someone? 😐  

Until recently, you had two options:

1. Engage in a tedious back-and-forth process trying to find a suitable time slot and then send a calendar invitation, or

2. Use an external service like [_Calendly_](https://calendly.com/) , which can sometimes feel impersonal and introduce a [social dynamic](https://www.makeuseof.com/calendly-scheduling-share-your-link-politely/) between you and the other person if not handled delicately.

👉 Thankfully, Google has recently introduced a similar and fantastic feature called ["Appointment Scheduling with Google Calendar."](https://workspace.google.com/resources/appointment-scheduling/)

With appointment scheduling, you can easily manage your availability and allow clients, partners, friends, or family to book time with you directly through Google Calendar using a personal booking page.

And here's the cherry on top - if you have a _Google Business account_, you can integrate **payments** 💳 (through Stripe) and enable people to pay for your time!

So, have you thought of any exciting ideas on how to make the most of this feature? Share your thoughts below!

## 5/ LK-99 'Superconductor'

What is a superconductor?

> A superconductor is a material that exhibits superconductivity, a state of matter with zero electrical resistance and the inability to allow magnetic fields to penetrate. This unique property enables an electric current in a superconductor to persist indefinitely.

🥶 Typically, achieving superconductivity requires extremely **cold** temperatures.

Superconductors find a wide range of applications in everyday life, from MRI machines to super-fast maglev trains that use magnets to levitate and reduce friction, but the need for low temperatures makes them unusable for day-to-day operations.

Scientists 🔬 have been researching to [develop superconductors that work at higher temperatures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPadRwJbylY), which could revolutionize energy transport and storage.

Recently, a group of South Korean scientists made a **groundbreaking** claim that they have created the world's [first room-temperature superconductor](https://www.theverge.com/23820077/lk-99-superconductor-experts).

🚀 If this claim is valid, it has the potential to transform the direction of technology for humanity completely.

However, as the Greek proverb says, **_"When you hear about many cherries, hold a small basket."_** 🧺

In the past few days, numerous people have attempted to [replicate the process of creating LK-99](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02481-0), but they have not succeeded so far.  

So the question remains: Is this another elaborate scam, or is it truly the most significant scientific discovery of the 21st century?

That's all for now. See you next week!
