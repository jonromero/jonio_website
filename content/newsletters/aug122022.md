If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**üîó!

üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Starbucks is ready to unveil its web3 strategy. It has to do with their [rewards cards](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/03/starbucks-to-unveil-its-web3-based-rewards-program-next-month/) - which bring an extra [1.4 billion](https://moguldom.com/357346/starbucks-customers-have-a-balance-of-1-4-billion-on-the-app-interest-free-loan/) üí∞ to Starbucks.

I heard that you'd be able to use them natively in their app - which is going to be awesome.

<br>

2/ My _**NFT Platform**_ that I built in 14 days for a hackathon has almost crossed **800** üöÄ **users**.

üí° **This is how I did it.**


**Step** 1Ô∏è‚É£

I believe that it is the easiest and fastest platform for creating NFTs. Everything is built around the philosophy that **YOU DON'T NEED TO BE A CRYPTO BRO TO GET A TICKET**. This helped a lot in my next step.

**Step** 2Ô∏è‚É£ 

I did a bit of growth hacking on Twitter by piggybacking on LA Tech Week - a huge event with thousands of people who cannot get an invitation. So, I created an event for _"Rejects of LA Tech Week"_ and got another 300 users.

The ticket is here to take a look: [LA Tech Rejects](https://futuretickets.xyz/e/la-tech-rejects_EBj18NcaXe).

And below are some of the interactions:

Go to the bottom for more epic interactions with users! üëá


**Step** 3Ô∏è‚É£

I responded to _**EVERY SINGLE**_ bug/future request in less than an hour. If you don't do this, you don't have 800 users; you have 800 entries in the database.


**Step** 4Ô∏è‚É£

I am adding more features, but I generally love having non-stop feedback and at least 10 hardcore users within 3 days of launching.


There is definitely a market there, but for the time being, I love building things people find useful.

<br>

3/ Is having **competition** a good or a bad thing for your startup ‚ùì

Building a new product in a completely new space is risky, and having a competitor helps you de-risk your work. If you have a competitor, you have additional proof that there is an actual market, and you are on to something.

4/ **The only limitations are the ones we put on ourselves.**

It's been a long since I last made excuses about building stuff.

I used to think:

> Not the right time.

or

> I might need this gadget/tool/service to build this

or (the worst)

> I AM NOT READY

**There is never "a right time". You are ready now. You don't need anything else.**

A great example is that [the Oscar-winning feature film PARASITE was edited with a 10-year-old copy of Final Cut Pro 7.](https://twitter.com/noamkroll/status/1556755415353925642?t=bVLXbyWmPnIhY1_2hClwMg&s=19)

**The only limitations are the ones we put on ourselves.**

<br>

5/ In this newsletter, we often discuss the importance of a solid **decision-making process.**

You are lost in life if you don't have a framework for evaluating scenarios and making decisions.

Here is an awesome collection of thinking tools and frameworks to help you solve problems, make decisions and understand systems.
