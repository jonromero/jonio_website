👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ The Metaverse is epic, and Mark Zuckerberg is a genius, but not for the reasons you think.

Recently I read [SuperBetter](https://www.amazon.com/SuperBetter-Living-Gamefully-Jane-McGonigal/dp/0143109774), a book about improving your life through gamification.

The book mentions a lot of research, but ONE experiment stood out. They gathered three groups of people, with the goal of testing which group would lose the most weight.

* **Group A** got the traditional instructions (eat well, exercise, etc.)
* **Group B** used a game where you had an avatar that told you what exercises to do and tips about your diet.
* **Group C** (you better sit down for this) used a game where the avatar looked LIKE you. 

People in _Group C_ lost the most weight AND kept it for up to three years (group B was the second best choice). 🤯

How long have these people played this game? 

> 15 minutes ONCE per week.

Collect your mind that I just blew away, and here is why the Metaverse is epic.

Based on a new report, [learning and training in the Metaverse](https://datatechvibe.com/data/can-working-via-metaverse-increase-productivity/) have 20% to 40% better results than traditional means. 📈

This number **doubles** for people that work from home.

I believe Meta's Metaverse will help people connect better with others and themselves.

2/ On the other hand, [Metaverse is struggling to keep users.](https://futurism.com/the-byte/facebook-metaverse-users-quit-month) 🤔

The reason is that the hardware is glitchy, no one likes wearing "VR glasses" to work on their computer, and there is not so much stuff to do.

The funny thing with every radical new technology is that you don't know whether it is a brilliant or stupid idea.

3/ **This December, Greece 🇬🇷 becomes the place for the biggest Web3 Creators conference.** 

Here is how.

Whenever I go to Greece, I spend a whole month talking with Startups and Entrepreneurs about "the future" and what is happening in the US Tech scene.

I am not kidding — a **WHOLE MONTH**.

Now, instead of spending a whole month of my vacation, I decided to do ONE event to get everyone together. To talk about technology, fundraising, crypto, and all the geeky stuff I like.

I posted on my social media, and I got 3.000 people. And that's how my first **"V as in Metaverse" conference** started (you can [read more about it here](https://jon.io/organizing-a-crypto-conference-in-europe-in-less-than-a-month)).

Now, this December, I am coming back to Greece. And I have three months to plan and a huge community and friends helping out. And we already have the most mind-blowing speakers that, trust me, your mind will not be able to process.

I won't say much now (I plan to release more about the schedule in the coming weeks), but you can subscribe to the simplest site ever made for the biggest conference on earth [right here.](https://jon.io/metaverse2022)

Please send a message to `me[at]jon.io` if you want to help, and we'll reach out!


Let's do this! 🚀

4/ In a [past newsletter](https://jon.io/i-am-using-ai-to-decorate-my-house), we talked about one of the greatest business books of all time; [Zero to One.](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296)

But did you know that Peter Thiel, the book's author, has his own program for entrepreneurs?

The [Thiel Fellowship](https://thielfellowship.org/) gives $100,000 💰 to young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom. Thiel Fellows skip or stop out of college to receive a $100,000 grant and support from the Thiel Foundation's network of founders, investors, and scientists.

> Two years. $100,000.
> Some ideas can't wait.

5/ Wait. 🤚

You still haven't registered for the biggest **Web3 Creators conference** in Greece this December? 😮

Here is a glimpse of what we did last year. And I can assure you that this year will be 10X more EPIC.
