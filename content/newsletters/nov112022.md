👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ This week, crypto almost **died**. 🪦 And yes, this is the story of FTX, but with some facts, you don't know (and are highly illegal).

The story behind FTX is simple:

**FTX** is (was) one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges. Through shady dealings, they "lost" 10 Billion dollars of customer funds. **Binance** tried to acquire them, and after just one day, they said, _"Nah, probably not a good idea"_.

That means if you had ANY money to FTX, well, kiss them goodbye. 🫠

But that's not why crypto almost died.

There is a loophole to withdraw your money (the same money that belongs now to creditors) if you are a resident of the Bahamas. As you can imagine, tons of people started paying **$100k** to **$1M** to people working for FTX to "update" their residency.

**Smart right?** 🤔

Depends if you like a prison as this is extremely illegal.

And that's the danger that could kill crypto. Pilling up criminal activity.

Do you believe that the crash of FTX happened for a good reason? 🕵🏼

2/ **Guest who lost 1 Trillion? 🤯**

No, it is not **Elon Musk** (yet). Which, by the way, has the most expensive loan in the history of tech (13 Billion dollars - 1 billion dollars in interest rate PER YEAR).

It's not [**Meta** that had to fire 11k people.](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/09/technology/meta-layoffs-facebook.html)

It's [**Amazon**.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-09/amazon-hits-unwelcome-milestone-with-1-trillion-in-value-lost)

**Microsoft** is not far behind with losing $889 billion.

I wonder what **Apple** is doing.

3/ **779** tech companies w/ layoffs ∙ **120.155** employees laid off ∙ In **2022**

4/ Sadly, you can't do much when a company is doing layoffs. 🤕

But you can always work harder (& smarter) and improve your skills and make yourself more competitive in the job market.

If you are in the middle of the process of looking for a new job, you know that the hiring process is ultra-competitive. But there are specific actions you can take to stand out.

Here are **16 ways to stand out in a hiring process** (from [Sahil Bloom](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sahilbloom_hiring-process-hacks-activity-6996815949605576704-rl3V/))

1. Stop Fearing Rejection 
2. Leverage Warm intros 
3. Targeted Outreach 
4. Nail the Cover letter 
5. Do your research 
6. Carry a notebook 
7. Prepare for "Tell me about yourself."
8. Prepare for "Why us."
9. Embrace "I don't know." 
10. Highlight Learning as a goal 
11. Cite Real weaknesses 
12. Play to your strengths 
13. Show your passion 
14. Pass the plane test

5/ **If you die in the game, you die in real life.** 💀

The founder of Oculus created a VR headset that, [if you lose, you die in real life.](https://futurism.com/oculus-founder-vr-headset-kills)

How?

🧨 **Explosives**. That destroys your brain when the screen flashes red at a specific frequency (during a game over - HOPEFULLY).

The "game" is mostly a piece of experimental art and won't be available for sale.

People say that it is still better than the new Oculus. 😅

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
