Hello hello hello! I am wondering what is the thing that you were doing right now and I interrupted you. I would love to know, so please reply to this email and let me know (and I'll tell you what the majority of our community is doing).

Ok, right to the chase (in Greece we say "right to the cooked meat").

1/ I've started ["Office Hours"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn2w-ZYozDU) on YouTube, where I review Startups **for free**. So if you want to learn from others or you have an idea to review, check the detailed post right here.

2/ The first [NFT fashion line](https://www.instagram.com/p/CT5fBcYPw9T/) will go live pretty soon. If you have any idea about fashion (or lines :D), I would love to pick your brain

3/ I read in one sitting Derek's new book ["How to Live"](https://sive.rs/h). Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is a small but condensed book of knowledge and you'll keep re-reading it.



4/ [Mailchimp got acquired for $12 Billion](https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-weekly-mailchimp-uber-ron-klain-9-2021) and the employees got Zero (with a capital Z). The founders walked away with $5 Billion each. Remember: getting a salary gets you through the day, getting equity gets you through a life (I don't even know if that makes sense, I just came up with it).


5/ SEC moves aggressively towards crypto by forcing Coinbase to drop their [lending product](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/following-sec-lawsuit-threat-coinbase-cancels-launch-of-lend-product/). The real question is whether the US (and subsequently the whole world) will embrace crypto or outlaw it?


Thatâ€™s it for today. See you next week.
