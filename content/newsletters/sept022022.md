👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Whenever you are chasing a dream, and you feel terrible and hopeless, remember the rule of thirds:

* 1/3 of the time, you should feel _**awesome**_
* 1/3 of the time, you should feel _**"ok."**_
* 1/3 of the time, you should feel like _**crap**_

If the ratio is off, reevaluate and go at it again.

2/ Can you use free tools to create A.I-based fashion?

Oh, not only can you, but you can even create [videos](https://gifyu.com/image/SwIhr)!

[Karen X. Cheng](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1564626773001719813?t=4roBuVGjuC21ISMGpBckIw&s=19) posted an insane free workflow that you should check out.

The future is looking more and more epic. 🚀 🤯

3/ My favorite **conspiracy theory** has to do with Leonardo DiCaprio.

The idea is that _**he never dates women over 25**_, and you can see from the chart that it is **kind of true.**

The chart is not 100% accurate as it doesn't include his latest girlfriend - oh, sorry, I meant to say, ex-girlfriend.

Can you guess her age? 😄

<br>

4/ Do you want to start with AI but are completely lost?

Don't worry! [Google AI](https://ai.google/) got you covered. 🤖

Google has created the most comprehensive website around AI, containing tools, educational material, articles, datasets, and everything you need to get your hands dirty with AI.

<br>

5/ Google decided to try a [radical way to discover top talent and attract employees](https://www.inc.com/kelly-main/hiring-google-experience-aptitude.html?fbclid=IwAR0NM0FCNW_bogCG3Cx3kt3mu1mb6oP2futY2Xu24P1xvPW1p3DvyfT78ps). 👨‍💼 And no, it's not based on **degrees** or **working experience.**

Instead of looking for fancy degrees and extensive experience, launched a [Certification program in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-project-management) and measured candidates' aptitude by the quality of their coursework.

This gave Google insight into the real quality of work of each candidate. What do you think about this approach?

Will you ever hire someone based on the online courses they completed? 🤔

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
