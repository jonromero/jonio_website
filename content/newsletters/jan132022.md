It is 2022 and and I am super excited! So many new stuff coming up and so many new opportunities! Let's jump straight to the top 5 highlights.

1/ This week I review the pitch deck of a Startup that wants to make it easier for you to buy [Real Estate ... in the Metaverse!](https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ)

I really like the idea but there is an issue that I haven't talked about in any other video and it has to do with Startups that have only **one** founder.

I would love to hear your opinion, so please leave a comment on the [video](https://youtu.be/KsugU9YKkHQ).

2/ Ready to have your mind blown into pieces? ðŸ¤¯

[China has built a factory robot that reads minds](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3162257/chinese-scientists-build-factory-robot-can-read-minds-assembly).
Why? So it can predict their needs you silly! And here is the scenario.
You want a wrench? Why lose those precious 3 seconds to think and act when **a machine can sense your needs and grab it for you**? Isn't all about optimization?

I would love to hear your opinion about this - let me know what you think at ðŸ“¥ me@jon.io

3/ What is Wrong with Being Right?

Most people never work as hard as they do when they are trying to prove themselves right. **But not you!**

The next time you will catch yourself caring more about being right than to get the best possible outcome, **_STOP_** and _**THINK**_.

> Do I want to be right? Or do I care more about creating the best possible work?

If you want to be unbeatable, you have to give up on always trying to "be right" and _**FOCUS**_ on what truly matters. Don't get trapped on the [Wrong Side of Right!](https://fs.blog/wrong-side-right/)

<br>

4/ Whoa! Today we made it to number (4) without talking about NFTs! Let's change that. 

Do you have any idea how big was the creators' economy using Ethereum in 2021? Take a guess, I'll wait. 

> [3.5 Billion](https://twitter.com/0xstark/status/1479478884072505346?t=KfQ9krEz3uTOgdUMzP9yig&s=19) ðŸ’°

INSANE. 

It gets me very sad when I see people missing out on this great wealth shift. 

<br>

5/ Oh who knew! [Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather Jr. sued for involvement in alleged crypto scam](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kim-kardashian-and-floyd-mayweather-jr-sued-for-allegedly-making-false-statements-about-the-crypto-ethereummax-11641918153).

[Tons of hacks](https://twitter.com/CityDAO/status/1480421505385197575?s=20) in the crypto space and a lot of scams going around so be EXTREMELY careful. 

The only thing that matters in the end is community and adoption. Anything else is just hype and sophisticated scams.

<br>

See you next week. ðŸš€
