**These are the highlights of the past week!**

<br>

1/ It's time for you to work for a DAO. At least part-time. Or you won't have any job in the future. ‚ö†Ô∏è

I've written [many times about DAOs](https://jon.io/becoming-a-genius-robots-in-preschools-and-daos-against-hedge-funds), but now it is time to talk about a DAO that I helped start: **KaramelaDAO**.

[KaramelaDAO's](https://karameladao.com/) main purpose is to let people experiment with crazy ideas.

Some of the ideas we are playing around with are:

1. Buying an island and converting it to a crypto island
2. Creating a Virtual Influencer from scratch
3. Reaching $1B in revenue

Pretty crazy ideas if you ask me. ü§Ø

KaramelaDAO has Citizens, its own currency ($Lollipop) that is connected to its treasury (that's a first!), and a very vibrant community.

Having participated in many DAOs, if you want to experience the future of work, [come and join us on Discord.](https://discord.gg/xXYWhbNvyS)

We even have a team for onboarding, and they will give you some $Lollipops for free, guide you on how to use your wallets, how to vote, how to propose new stuff, and tons of other cool info that will take you a couple of months to figure out yourself. You can even earn $Lollipops by completing bounties!

Oh, and if you want to become a Citizen, [you can grab one of our 10 Citizen NFTs](https://omgdrops.com/karameladao/karameladao-nft-citizenship-first-builders_XnrLpELhoy/) that come with a digiphysical (you get an actual hat!), and 250 $lolls per year for four years (like vesting)!

2/ A couple of weeks ago, [I posted about taking a monthly storytelling and filmmaking course.](https://jon.io/how-to-become-clark-kent-and-the-story-of-michael-jordan)

I've said many times that storytelling is vital to acquire and engage customers.

> It is not about the product. It is about the damn story.

Long story short, [this is the final video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihJZgEO8BI) I did for the course. I hope you enjoy it.

3/ A month ago, I posted on [my site](https://jon.io/) how you can make $300k üí∞ by switching to web3.

It seems that the price is now at [$750k per year](https://thedefiant.io/web3-soaring-salaries/).

Any bets what's happening 6 months from now? ü§î

<br>

4/ _**"Jon, you are wrong! Web3 is dead. The Product Lead of Crypto at VISA just left to join a payments company."**_

This is an email from one of my readers at [my site](https://jon.io/) that works for a pretty big company in the US.

Well, she is right. Partially.

Yes, Daniel left VISA. [For a Payments Company.](https://thefifthskill.com/visas-crypto-product-lead-leaves-for-payments-startup/)

To be more accurate, he joined [THIS COMPANY](https://www.ansiblelabs.xyz/). Click the link and check what the first thing on their homepage is.

I'll save you a click: **web3**.

**He left VISA to join a web3 company.**

How is your CV?

<br>


5/ **$2.6 Billion dollars.** üí∞


That's [the amount of money raised last year from Startups that had "NFT" in the strategy.](https://news.crunchbase.com/news/nft-startups-seed-venture-growth-sxsw-yuga/)

And trust me on that, 99% of them should have stayed away from NFTs.

üí° If you are building a Startup, **focus on providing value**. If you want to raise money and work with VCs as your employers, add "NFT support" to your company, and good luck.
