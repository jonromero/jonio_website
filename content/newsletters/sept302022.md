👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ We all know (or believe we know) how to avoid phishing attacks, but scammers can become really sophisticated. In case you don't know about this incident; [hackers stole 💰 620mm from the Axie Infinity game via a fake job interview.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-stole-620-million-from-axie-infinity-via-fake-job-interviews/)

⏩ **TL: DR;**

Axie Infinity is a play-to-earn game with NFTs in the Ethereum blockchain, and Sky Mavis is the company developing this game.

**What hackers did:**

1. They created a fake company on Linked in and posted job ads that targeted Axie Infinity employees
2. One senior engineer applied and went through multiple rounds of interviews.
3. Hackers sent an appealing offer (as a pdf), and the employee opened the pdf file on his work laptop.
4. That's it. Hackers had access to their development environment and stole the funds.

👉 Be careful, guys, and always verify who you **trust** in the digital world.

2/ **All you need is 1000 True Fans.**

Kevin Kelly introduced the term 1000 True Fans in a [2008 blog post](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/), and it's a brilliant idea!

Think about it. If you could get 1000 True Fans to support you by buying _**$100**_ worth of what you create yearly, you would earn an income of _**$100,000**_ annually. 📈

But don't be foolish. Getting to this number, it's not easy. It requires hard work, but once you've built up 1000 True Fans, you are free to live as an independent creator earning good money making what you love.

Here is an excellent [book](https://www.amazon.com/1000-True-Fans-Kellys-Simple-ebook/dp/B01N9P9O4G) explaining the 100 True Fans concept.

4/ **Do you remember the NFT ticketing platform 🖼️ I built from scratch in just 14 days for a Polygon hackathon?**

Well, many event organizers have contacted me asking me to use [FutureTickets.xyz](https://futuretickets.xyz/) for their crypto events, and I'm really excited about it! 😀

5/ In this newsletter, we specialize in everything around Cryptocurrencies / Blockchain, AI/ Data Science, Startups, and Investing.

In a [past newsletter](https://jon.io/kamikazes-coca-cola-and-belgian-horses) a few months ago, I talked about [Numerai](https://numer.ai/), a pioneering project combining AI, Cryptocurrencies, and crowdsourced investing. Numerai is "the hardest data science tournament on the planet", where participants can earn crypto by submitting weekly predictions for the stock market using AI.

This week, our Chief of Chaos, [Panagiotis Papaemmanouil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panagiotis-papaemmanouil/), ranked #28 among 15.000 unique Machine Learning / Deep Learning models competing in the Numerai tournament.

**Way to go!** 🚀
