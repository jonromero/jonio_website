👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Working on your Startup in your free time is a viable option. You don't need to leave your day job.

Take, for example, the CEO of Goldman Sachs. 😏

Goldman Sachs is worried about its CEO because he is [focused on being a DJ](https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-dj-wall-street-staffers-2022-9) and is asking employees to help promote his events (oh, and he is also using the company's private jet).

If you really want it, you can make it happen (but don't use company resources).

<br>

2/ Are you a creator who wants to multiply your audience? Or are you a movie producer who needs money for your movie? 

Check out this article about creators utilizing the [new web3 world](https://every.to/means-of-creation/the-new-creator-playbook-jumpstarting-communities-through-tokens) in order to build communities and raise money.

Here is [Shibuya](https://www.shibuya.xyz/), which raised **$1.2M** 💰 from their web3 community, and the audience gets to choose the next chapter, the actors, etc.


<br>

3/ 📣 I am looking for a **"Head of memes"** 🫡 for my NFT Ticketing platform [FutureTickets](https://futuretickets.xyz/).

Their job will be to post memes on our **Twitter** account and make comments on Twitter threads related to tickets, POAP, etc.

📥 Send me a message or email if you are interested or know someone who might be interested!

<br>

4/ Are you ready for a killer crash course in **copywriting for Landing Pages**? 📚

Here are the 7 tips that will help you dramatically increase your conversion rates, inspired by [this post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zainkahn_landing-page-playbook-activity-6975076058169524224-Ot7-). 

1. Nail the headline (make it short, punchy, and eye-catching) 
2. De-risk buyers' decision 
3. Sell outcomes instead of features 
4. Incentivize action 
5. Use numbers
6. Use social proof 
7. Write a killer Call-to-action (CAT)

Did I miss something? 🤔

<br>

5/ A few newsletters back, I talked about the importance of [focusing on one thing](https://jon.io/got-slammed-by-mark-cuban) and nailing it instead of pursuing multiple ventures and spending your time without meaningful results.

Many of you texted me back, telling me how **extremely difficult** this is, especially when many things are a **BIG HELL YEAH** at the same time.

I know. It's not easy. But believe me, you need to do it if you want massive results. Of course, you can always move to the next venture if you have scaled the first one or if it just failed!

Here is an excellent image illustrating the impact of focusing.

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
