1/ If you are an Entrepreneur, you should NEVER be impressed by companies that raise funds üí∞ or hit the news üì∞. Why?

Let me introduce you to Fast, a media darling.

Imagine raising $100M, laying off 50% of the company, trying to sell whatever remained, and shutting down all **IN SIX DAYS.**

Yes. [This is the story of the "Fast" company](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/fast-shuts-doors-after-slow-growth-high-burn-precluded-fundraising-options/) - no pun intended.

And don't get me wrong. **Startups are high-risk/high-return investments**, but being in the same category as PayPal, Stripe (which was an investor) and having **similar valuation** while **making only $600k per year** is stupid.

Why do I believe this burned to the ground? Let's see:

1. Fast was building a fast-one-click checkout. Seriously. HOW MUCH FASTER CAN A CHECKOUT BE? Google Pay, Amazon Pay, and Apple Pay are one click.
2. 500 employees for this product
3. $10M per month operating expenses. $10M per month
4. $600k revenue PER YEAR - I sold NFTs that made more money

Funding doesn't mean a thing. It usually means that you have predatory VCs screwing up your vision.

2/ Do you know why companies will never be innovative?

üìé Read below the HILARIOUS and out-of-touch interview of Jerry Seinfeld in the latest Harvard Business Magazine.

The whole conversation goes like this:

* Harvard - Hey Jerry, you got tired and stuck writing jokes all these years. Have you thought of bringing McKinsey to help out? (I am not making this up)
* Jerry - Who is McKinsey?
* Harvard - A consulting company
* Jerry - Are they funny?
* Harvard - No
* Jerry - Then I don't need them

WHO on this planet thought that McKinsey would be beneficial to a show like Seinfeld?

Companies hire consultants that have **no idea** what's really going on. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are in the trenches.

Be an Entrepreneur, and I guarantee you that bigger companies will have to buy you out. Or face extinction.

3/ Last week, I had a [YouTube live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bW650irzNlw) üì∫ where I built LIVE a smart contract for a Decentralized Exchange ü§ñ. The live went for almost an hour and a half, and I answered questions like:

1. How I create project - my methodology
2. Which blockchain is the best to deploy a smart contract?
3. How can I build my own cryptocurrency?
4. How to deploy my smart contract?
5. Which libraries should I be using so I don't lose all my money?

Next week, I'll release the second part of the video about the UI.

5/ Do you want to control your mind with your body? Here is my Wim Hoff journey.

I've been practicing Wim Hoff for some time now, and I fell in love with the breathing exercises and the cold showers. And if you know me, I hate cold ü•∂. It is one of the many reasons why I love Los Angeles üåû.

I transitioned to ice-cold baths (yes, that's me, in my backyard, inside a container full of ice), and I found the following:

üí°We are trying to control our bodies with our minds. Meditation. Inspiring music. Self-talk. We know that if we tame our minds, the body will follow. Cold showers are the only thing that makes my body control my mind. And it is epic.

Racing thoughts? Stress? Under the weather? Indecisive? 

Take a cold shower.

It is like a shortcut to tame the monkey in your head. Fast, always there, and unable to doge.

I could talk about cold showers and their benefits for hours, but my good friend Andrew did a scientific 2-hour podcast about this - on my birthday.

üì• I'd love to hear your experience or why you haven't done this yet. I can give you some tips on starting and "embracing the cold".
