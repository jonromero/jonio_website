👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **Released!** 🎉

Two weeks ago, [I joined a hackathon to build from scratch](https://jon.io/creating-the-most-epic-nft-ticketing-platform-in-14-days) a "one-of-kind" new **NFT Ticketing platform**.

It was more difficult than I imagined (it always is!), but I can proudly say that the platform is called [FutureTickets.xyz](https://futuretickets.xyz/), it is life!

You can try it out by [claiming a free NFT Ticket.](https://futuretickets.xyz/e/your-first-nft-ticket_91nox70YHN)  🎟️

It is totally free 🆓 and you don't have to know anything about crypto! That's part of the magic! ✨

Check out the [release video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21IE5Tmh-nM) that includes a walk-through of the platform, and if you want to try it out, leave a comment below (even creating events is free!).

2/ Let's play a **game**! 🎲

I'll throw some _words_ out now, and let's see what you make of them.

_**Book, puzzle, interactive, cross-media.**_

If you instinctively thought ["Journal 29"](https://journal29.com/) congrats! If you didn't, fear not because you can learn about the 3rd installment of the best-selling interactive puzzle book by checking out its [super-successful Kickstarter campaign.}(https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchassapakis/journal-29-oblivion/)

But that's not all. Let me throw out some more words here. 

_**Puzzle, cinematic, episodic, club, storytelling, mystery, web3.**_

If you instinctively thought, ["One Mystery Club"](https://onemystery.club/) kudos. If you didn't, check out this jaw-dropping teaser and subscribe to the club's mailing list, so we all find out what this thing is all about. I, for one, surely did.

Maybe we form a room in my discord and try solving some puzzles?

<br>

3/ Last few days, **Solana wallets** (Phantom, Slope, and TrustWallet) were targeted in [the latest multimillion-dollar hack.](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/08/03/phantom-wallet-exploit-drains-millions-in-sol-tokens/)

> Compromised Phantom wallets came from seed phrase imports used in Slope. Compromised ETH wallets were also from seed phrase reuse.

For everyone reading this, **"Do not reuse your seed phrase on a hardware wallet - create a new seed phrase. Wallets drained should be treated as compromised and abandoned."**

4/ Do you want to be **unstoppable**?

[Here are 103 bits of advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known) that the founder of Wired posts every year.


Some of my **favorites**:

- Don't ever work for someone you don't want to become.
- You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.
- Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.
- Don't believe everything you think you believe.
- Don't bother fighting the old; just build the new.

5/ For the readers of this newsletter who are **trying to build and manage a team.**

> If you are an employer, not investing in your people, you're not investing in the future of your business.

Here are [16 simple ways to invest in your employees and reduce turnover.](https://wheniwork.com/blog/reduce-employee-turnover?fbclid=IwAR3HZ5lOib6_f_D_fKfP5AJXAMJ20ppWM-7gS9AzsNlx9In6Wj---Ou9P3I)

My top 5 are: 

1. Invest in their personal and professional development
2. Compensate competitively
3. Set clear expectations for each role
4. Create a feedback culture
5. Prioritize work/life balance

See you next week. 🚀
