# New Year - new goals - and a new app!

Yes, I made a new app - and it can help you learn how to invest (and maybe make some money while having fun!).


It is called [Ticker](https://heyticker.com) and it let's you create a portfolio from 7 stocks and compete with other people EVERY week. The best portfolio gets $50 and bragging rights :D


Try it out and let me know what do you think!

## More videos and a book!

This year I want to do more videos that showcase how I built apps/companies and how (and why) you can do it. 

But also, I want to write a book about living your best life. 

We'll see. 

Happy new year and oh - here are three videos I posted some time ago in case you haven't seen them!

2\ [I made 1 MILLION DOLLARS by Investing in Tesla Stock instead of Buying the Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHIBQix-vSc)
