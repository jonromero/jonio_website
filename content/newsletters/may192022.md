These are the **highlights** of the past week!

<br>


1/ If you are looking for a new job, a new role, or just a **raise**, here is a trick to **get 15% more money**.

> And yes, there is one **simple** trick.

**Most people never negotiate their salary. Never.**

That is insane. ü§Ø

Most of them were afraid that they might lose their position because they asked for more money. I can tell you right now that a company that won't hire you because you asked for more money **during** negotiations is a company that you should avoid at all costs.

There are some obvious exceptions - like being delusional and asking an insane amount. But let's talk about my trick.

Each company has a specific budget for a position. It doesn't matter if you are god-on-earth; you won't get a higher salary than the allocated budget. That also means that you can "push" your way to the upper bracket of the position because that budget is available for taking. üòÄ

The way to find the upper bracket is through research. Look what similar (competitor) companies pay or try to find anyone you know at that company and ask them. Sometimes they might even know the hiring manager.

My approach is **just to ask**: _what is the budget for this position?_

Every single time, you'll get a number, and you can safely **add 5%-15%** to that. No hiring manager quotes the upper limit, but they often mention the lower. And only an inexperienced HR manager will ask, _"how much money do you want?"_.

Have you negotiated your salary? What was your experience?

2/ Did you know that **Madonna released an NFT project?** If not, oh, you are in for a surprise.

Check [Mother of Creation](https://motherofcreation.xyz/) - it is NSFW.

3/ People keep asking me: _**"How is really the glorious life of an Entrepreneur?"**_.

4/ In [my previous email](https://jon.io/the-wealth-transfer-has-started-but-it-is-not-what-you-think), I wrote about how Apple lost its Director of Machine Learning because they wanted everyone back in the office.

It seems now that [Apple has reversed its decision](https://gizmodo.com/apple-return-to-work-policy-alphabet-machine-learnin-1848942742/amp), but it probably is too late now because ML Director Ian Goodfellow will reportedly join Alphabet's DeepMind.
