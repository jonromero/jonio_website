If you found this newsletter interesting, I would love it if you could **share it**üîó!

üëâ These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

**1/ What would you do if an A.I. started sexually harassing you?**

That's what [happened with users](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34d43/my-ai-is-sexually-harassing-me-replika-chatbot-nudes) of the app Replika, a virtual companion.

I remembered the founder (Eugenia) building a long time ago what might later become the prototype of Replika when her friend died (a memorial bot).

[Definitely read the story](https://www.theverge.com/a/luka-artificial-intelligence-memorial-roman-mazurenko-bot) - it's amazing!

What do you think about A.I. trying to help people get over **emotions** of sadness and loneliness? ü§î

<br>

2/ Let's say a **robot** is making your coffee or drink or a dessert - like this robot I took a picture of in Cyprus.

**Would you tip it?**

A huge conversation has started with companies adding a mandatory tip for [services performed by robots](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/tipping-robots/).

Maybe the tip goes to the service people? üßê

<br>

3/ You've heard about **DALL-E**, the A.I. program that generates images from text prompts but do you know about **VALL-E**?

It can generate **VERY** accurate voices from very short samples. [Check out the paper and tons of examples.](https://valle-demo.github.io/)

The day when actors will just license their faces/voices is coming fast!

<br>

4/ [JP Morgan is far from satisfied with its latest startup investment.](https://futurism.com/jpmorgan-claims-startup-tricked-acquisition-fake-users)

A few months ago, JPMorgan acquired a college financial aid platform called **‚ÄúFrank‚Äù** for a whopping **$175 million**. But then, when they tried to send an email to their entire customer base of 4,000,000 users, 70% of the emails "bounced back". 

This strange incident led to a thorough investigation that revealed the truth. 

> The vast majority of platform users were fake! 

Only 300,000 of the 4,000,000 total users were real people, which made JPMorgan nervous about this deal. 

Of course, [JPMorgan sued founder Charlie Javice](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23570243/frank_suit.pdf) and provided evidence that he allegedly hired a Data Science professor to create the fake accounts. 

Well, I guess doing **proper due diligence** before buying a startup is a challenging process, and you can never be sure (or not).

<br>

5/ One of my **goals** üéØ for 2023 is

> **Less calls, only do meetings that involve physical activity**

And there is a reason for this. 

I don't know if you've noticed this, but **ideas** flow like a river when you're taking a walk, while the opposite happens in a meeting when you try to force it.

üí° So the next time you feel stuck, just take a walk and let all these smart ideas come to you.

Let me know if you are already doing it and how it works for you. I'd love to learn more. üì•

<br>

That's all for now. See you next week! üöÄ
