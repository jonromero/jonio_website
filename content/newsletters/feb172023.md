👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ **"Epic."**

Here is how a "brand" used ONE word to go viral. And it wasn't random at all.

Last September, Amtrak posted on their Twitter a single word.

> Trains.

And then every single other brand started posting their own one-word description.

For NASA was the "universe". Macdonalds was the "clown".

The whole one-word-viral tweet took 3 months of preparation, and the idea behind it is a smart tweet to make you "stop the scroll".


And now I am wondering. Did my "epic" trick work on you?

Read the interview about how they did it [right here](https://milkkarten.substack.com/p/amtraks-trains-tweet-went-through?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).

What's your one-word description? 😎

2/ The rumors of the **death of the Metaverse** are greatly exaggerated.

I keep reading posts about the death of the Metaverse, all while 58% of people on social media follow at least one Virtual Influencer.

It is ridiculous how the Metaverse is already spreading in our everyday life, and people are oblivious. That's ok, though. More money for those that know 😉

I've previously talked about Virtual Influencers - and how oblivious Europe is about this epic market trend.

If you have no idea what a Virtual Influencer is, check out this [new Startup](https://superplastic.co/pages/talent) that just secured **$20M** in funding.

3/ It is February 2023, and I just remembered that I haven't given any ✌️ **$Victory coins** yet!

In case you have no idea what $Victory coins are, it's [my social currency](https://victory.jon.io/what) that you cannot buy nor sell - and you get it because you are awesome! You can redeem it for swag and calls with me (at least when the marketplace is online - seriously, it is coming!).

Having said that, here are [499 $Victory coins](https://victory.jon.io/claim/2023) to get you started for 2023

<br>

4/ Last week, [Microsoft had some exciting news!](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/microsoft-announces-ai-powered-bing-search-and-edge-browser/)

They integrated the AI Language Model from OpenAI into the Bing search engine and the Edge browser. This will allow users to see AI-annotated search results and chat with an AI model similar to ChatGPT!

After more than 10 years of Google dominating search, Microsoft is back in the game, and the internet search war is on!

For anyone interested, the new Bing is available for a limited preview at [bing.com/new](http://bing.com/new).

5/ The field of **Artificial Intelligence has been booming** for the past 6 months.

🗂 GPT3, Dall-E2, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, ChatGPT, ... and so many more!

The market is **flooded** with AI tools for countless use cases. And it becomes difficult for users to find the right tool for their problem.

But as a reader of this newsletter, you shouldn't have that problem. I found for you 3 of the most comprehensive lists of AI tools on the entire web. So the next time you look for an AI tool, this is your starting point.

That's all for now. See you next week! 🚀
