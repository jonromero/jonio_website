Here are the top five things for this week. Oh and Happy New Year!

1/ Last week I had **Live Office hours** and we talked about Web3 for Entrepreneurs! [Here is the full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuRa8xC9chk) where I cover Web3, best DAOs, what a DAO is and tons of other questions.

2/ In case you don't know, we have a DAO - called [KaramelaDAO](https://twitter.com/karameladao). On our twitter we talk about how we built our DAO and we have a DAO Historian that writes [once per week about the cool things that we build](https://mirror.xyz/karameladao.eth).

The goal is to have a small community of 300 people that get to build interesting stuff and experiment with these new social structures. ][Join us on our Discord if you want to check it out](https://discord.gg/rcMREKNA3X).

3/ [When I first asked Entrepreneurs to send me their pitch decks](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnvlachoyiannis_startups-founders-activity-6832905191004753920--LCW) and I'll review them, I had no idea I'll be doing YouTube videos for two months and have 600+ pitch decks in the pipeline.



But that's not the awesome part. Today I am happy to announce that I am an investor to one of the companies that I reviewed on my channel, [Zenus.AI](https://www.zenus.ai/). The pitch deck if you want to check it out is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUlE3gDqrvQ).



But there is something even awesomer. Three investors reached out to me after watching the pitch deck and now they are also investors in Zenus.AI.



You can still [send me your pitch deck here](https://jon.io/startup-office-hours) and I'll review it some time in 2022.



4/ DAOs are the hottest thing right now ([as I have been saying for the last two months](https://jon.io/becoming-a-genius-robots-in-preschools-and-daos-against-hedge-funds)) mostly because they introduce new business metrics.



> For a DAO to work, you need to have an MLC - a Minimum Lovable Community.

But do you really know what a DAO is and how they started?



Below is a [new video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rs6-8kllBCc) that is "different" from my previous ones. I would love to hear what you think about it as I really like this style but definitely I need more work to pull it off.


Watch it and tell me if it was captivating or if you got bored. I really want to know what you think.

5/ Story time.



Mark Cuban almost never invests in other people's funds because "he doesn't enjoy it" but he invested $6M in [Backstage Capital](https://twitter.com/Backstage_Cap). When [the founder asked him why](https://twitter.com/ArlanWasHere/status/1475879762895593472?t=6QGdkDK1GF60yg1Gn810NA&s=19), he said:


> You’re in rooms I’ll never be in


Do you want to make a 10x difference? Leave the room you are, either it is a town, country or company and **be in the "future" room**.


See you next year!
