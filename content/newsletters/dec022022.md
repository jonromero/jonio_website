👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

1/ Europe wanted to be part of the Metaverse and [spent $387k](https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-threw-e387k-meta-gala-nobody-came-big-tech/) on a party. And it was the lamest part on the planet. 😐

Not only did five people show up (ok, reports say that at LEAST 12 people showed up), but the whole platform couldn't handle the traffic.

Personally, I liked the [style](https://twitter.com/EU_Partnerships/status/1580591048593911808), but **$387k** seems a bit excessive.

The **sad** part of the story? Another **$300 Billion** 💰 are allocated to Metaverse projects.

The **saddest** part? The whole initiative is a reaction to a similar project China has launched.

2/ My [MetaVerse conf](https://jon.io/metaverse2022) is in two weeks, and I am super **excited!**

Last week, I released some **MetaHats** 🧢, and everything was **sold out**; then I ordered some more, and they were **sold out again**, and now I have 5 left.

I won't be able to order more (I know you want them, they are epic, and they have numbers based on a new MetaVerse language I am working on) because I am bringing all the hats from Los Angeles. ✈️

4/ Open AI released its newest AI model 3 days ago, and IT'S MINDBLOWING! 🤯

In their own words:

> We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT, which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format allows ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. ChatGPT is a sibling model to InstructGPT, which is trained to follow instructions in a prompt and provide a detailed response.

💡 Go to Twitter and search for **"openai"** and **"ChatGPT"** and prepare to be amazed!

People are using this to get answers to general questions, write essays and poems, develop and debug code, discuss business ideas, and many more.

I believe that this model (and what is yet to come) will **change our world** in the same way that the **google search engine** did!

5/ Well, you don't believe me how EPIC the ChatGPT is, huh? 💯

Let's hear it from it, then.

> 🚨 Attention ChatGPT fans 🚨
>
> We have some EPIC news to share! ChatGPT, the revolutionary language model trained by OpenAI, has decided to write this post ALL BY ITSELF! 😱
> 
> Yes, that's right – ChatGPT is taking over and sharing its thoughts on its own abilities.
"Hello everyone! I am ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. I can assist with a wide range of tasks, from answering questions to providing personalized responses to your messages. I am constantly learning and improving, and I am excited to continue helping people in new and innovative ways."
But wait, there's more! Not only is ChatGPT an expert at language processing, but it also has a knack for storytelling. "I have the ability to generate original content, including posts like this one. I can create engaging narratives and add a unique twist to any story. Just give me a prompt and watch me go!"

> So if you want to experience the power of ChatGPT for yourself, don't wait – try it out today! You won't be disappointed. 🤖😎🤖
