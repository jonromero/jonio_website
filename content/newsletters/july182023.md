👉 These are the **crazy** things I learned last week.

<br>

## R360

There are many tests to find your _archetype_ that borders astrology 💫, but the following one from **R360** (a private group) is pretty top-notch.
Give it a try [here](https://archetypes.r360global.com/) - I am the Sage.  

What's yours ❓

## Blue Tape

I never go on vacations without this [paper tape](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00004Z4CP?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image). It is the ultimate hack. Seriously.

If you have kids, then you will find 100x more uses.

I don't want to bother you with why it is awesome. Just buy one, have it with you, and I guarantee you will use it non-stop. 💯

Ok, some people maybe want a use case 🩹, so here is how I use it:  

1.  Does your kid open cabinets? Tape them closed - paper tape leaves no mark.
2.  A red light in the room doesn't let you sleep? Paper tape it.
3.  Did something break? Paper tape it!
4.  Do You want to distract your kids? Put paper tape all over the place and watch them play with it.

Do you have any more use cases?

## Cruise

What does my trip to Siberia have in common with the largest cruise ship 🛳 ever made?

This is the most giant cruise ship ever made, and it will set sail this October.

It is **HUUUUUUGE**. 5 times bigger than Titanic and has 19 floors.

It is so big that it triggers a psychological reaction - fear of awe.

It is the same feeling I had in Siberia - I was just a lonely dot in Google Maps. A terrifying feeling that you are so far from humans - even though I was surrounded by them! 😶‍🌫

😬 Have you ever felt this?

## The AI battle continues!

🤖 If you've been experimenting with **LLMs (Large Language Models)** for building software, you probably know that using OpenAI's API is your best option. Other open-source models just haven't been good enough until now.  

But [META has just released LLAMA v2](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/18/meta-releases-llama-2-a-more-helpful-set-of-text-generating-models/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHUj4wR4_6ydvWYP3Fsv-NZ24CdAIes_gcD6mdeQCeHIJoZG0UpKa2EXDLGbVW7E1Ye8-rK0qS9CYFLWTzjSKBKIS61cigNzrsxWcg0on1HgeVhi8oSw9K9OVeHhJ3_GRMwkdklsBPbVDzbwhT1zb7RWjH_GFcLkqAL1XsNxBIXu) - an open-source model that **beats** all other open-source LLMS.

Are you currently working on a startup in this field? Planning to try out LLAMA v2? Let me know, and I might have some feedback and guidance for you. 📥

## Mousetrap

> **Mousetrap, Noun:** _a device designed to catch and typically kill mice, often utilizing a spring-loaded bar that snaps down on the mouse when it interacts with bait attached to the mechanism._

Do you know how easy it is to fall into the "mousetrap" of your daily life? 🐭  

Most people spend their days in cubicles, hoping that something better will come someday. But before they know it, 30 years have passed, and they find themselves in the same place.

But not you. You are a reader of this awesome newsletter, so you know how to avoid these traps.

🔥 Each of us has the potential to live a more purposeful life. We can choose to set goals, take risks, and positively impact the world. However, it's crucial to remember that achieving this won't happen by chance. We must be deliberate and mindful of our choices.

This post is a challenge to you to set 3️⃣ **goals** (not 2, not 4, it's important to be 3) and tirelessly work towards achieving them by the end of this year.

📈 Keep track of your progress (by writing down ✍️ your goals and steps towards them), and you will thank me in January 2024.

That's all for now. See you next week!
