A lot of Entrepreneurs ask me why in my [list of requirements for Angel investing](https://jon.io/get-jon-to-fund-you) I only invest in US-based Startups.

## The main reason is time. 

I am investing in TONS of Startups and I don't have time to figure out the regulations of every country. And then the taxes. And then the reporting. It's just too much.

Especially in Europe, it is a nightmare. I prefer companies that are based in the US and are raising a round via SAFE. 

Obviously, there are exceptions but unless you come from a recommendation from my network, I might not even find the time to respond. 

## What if you move to the US or start a company here?

If that was your plan ALL ALONG, then let's talk after everything is in place. 

But don't create a company in the US and then assume that you are going to raise money while you are chilling in Greece. Or Spain. Or wherever you are. 

It's very hard to raise money in the US if you are not based there. And it's a lot of work to move to the US.
