The way I build apps is very simple and fast:

The trick is to start very very small and try out the basic idea. For example, let's say you are building a TODO list with A.I. This is the description:

> My Todo list that helps you go through your daily tasks by looking at your calendar without you lifting a finger! How you ask? A.I! 

![](/images/anger.jpg)

Then I'll build a very very very simple TODO app that you cannot remove tasks, maybe doesn't have login but reads your calendar and creates tasks automatically for you.I'll keep fixing bugs and playing with the idea until I hit 50 users and then I'll start expanding the idea a little bit. Remember, the app is still in a pretty bad condition but the general functionality is there.

What I am looking for next, is something that IRRITATES people. Something that is missing and people send me emails. Example:

> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, please let me add tasks TO my calendar from the app

After I get a lot of people angry, I'll start implement the feature and MAKE IT A PAID ONE.

BOOM BOOM BOOM - I can hear your mind exploding.
