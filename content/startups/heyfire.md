A couple of weeks ago, I wrote ["How to find the perfect domain name for your Startup"](https://jon.io/five-steps-to-get-an-amazing-domain-name-for-your-startup) - inspired how I picked my name for my new app.

Ironically, I've chosen a different name - closer to my original idea.

Without further ado, let me present you with [HeyFire](https://heyfire.co/).

The decision for changing the name (again) was not random.

After talking with users, I figured out that it is best to lean more into the FIRE crowd as the app resonates better with them.

## Let's talk more about HeyFire

HeyFire helps you build financial portfolios by making it trivial to use prebuild and well-tested ones.
It also let's you experiment with different ideas, just by pressing some buttons.

It also helps you with "tracking and acting" - meaning it suggests optimizations - while showing you how your portfolio might be impacted if a crash happens.

Oh, and you can also share, compare and discuss with other people any ideas you might have.
