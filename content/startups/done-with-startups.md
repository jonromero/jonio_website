## I am done with Startups (with a twist)

I built startups that had tons of customers and amazing products.

I built startups that made an insane amount of money while being just a few HTML pages.

I built and sold startups, and the process is always the same:

Grind -> do what investors want -> do stuff that doesn't matter for the customers -> get money in the bank -> repeat.

A couple of years ago, I decided I am done with it. And you should be too.

## Lifeups instead of Startups

Lifeups Instead of Startups
Lifeups are companies that upgrade your (and everyone's involved) life.

I tried "Lifeup" – the art of making products **just for you and your customers, while you enjoy life** – in my previous company and I loved the process.

1. We built only what customers wanted.
2. We were 4 people.
3. The due diligence for the acquisition was super easy.
4. The codebase was poetry.
5. I didn't have to share any money with VCs.
6. I didn't have to talk with VCs (the best part).

And now, I am going to perfect "Lifeups" with my latest company which surprisingly is all about [Financial Freedom](https://heyfire.co).

## Hey Financial Independence

I can build exactly what I want: a 100% customer-funded company that prioritizes people's growth and adventures instead of losing time on VCs and stupid board meetings.

A company where we can over-engineer stuff just to make a small thing faster that less than 1% of our customers will ever notice.

A company where customers know that we'll never divert from our vision and we'll fix ALL bugs.

A company that doesn't have an expiration date because "we had to spend more for growth."

I got inspired by [Michael](https://x.com/mikekarnj) and his tweet, while walking back from the beach. On a Tuesday afternoon.
